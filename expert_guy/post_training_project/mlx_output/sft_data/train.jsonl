Since there are many possible 5-letter words in English and I don't have any clues yet, I should choose a strategic first word.\n\nGood first words in Wordle typically:\n1. Include common letters (like E, A, R, T, S)\n2. Have all unique letters (to test 5 different letters)\n3. Focus on vowels since most words have at least one vowel\n\nSome strong strategic first words include:\n- ADIEU (tests 4 vowels)\n- STARE (common letters)\n- ROATE (vowels and common consonants)\n- RAISE (common letters)\n- CRANE (common letters)\n- SLATE (common letters)\n\nI'll go with \"CRANE\" as my first guess. It's a common strategy word with frequently used letters:\n- C is reasonably common\n- R is very common\n- A is the most common vowel\n- N is common\n- E is the most common letter in English\n\nThis should give me good initial information about the secret word.\nFor my first guess in Wordle, I'll choose a word with common letters to maximize information.\n\n<guess>CRANE</guess>"}

Keep A in the 3rd position\n2. Try N in a different position (1st, 2nd, or 5th)\n3. Avoid using C, R, or E\n4. Introduce new letters to gather more information\n\nPossible positions for the word:\n_ _ A _ _\n\nWhere N could be in positions 1, 2, or 5.\n\nLet's try a word that:\n- Keeps A in position 3\n- Tests N in position 1\n- Introduces new letters to gather more information\n\nGood candidate letters to try would be common consonants like S, T, L, P, M, D and vowels like O, I, U.\n\nSome possible options:\n- NAILS (N in 1st position, A in 3rd)\n- NAVAL (N in 1st position, A in 3rd)\n- SNAIL (N in 2nd position, A in 3rd)\n- SPANK (N in 5th position, A in 3rd)\n- PLAIN (N in 5th position, A in 3rd)\n- QUANT (N in 5th position, A in 3rd)\n\nLet's go with \"PLAIN\":\n- P: New letter to test\n- L: New letter to test\n- A: Known correct position\n- I: New letter to test\n- N: Testing in position 5 (a new position)\n\nThis word keeps what we know (A in position 3), tests N in a new position, and introduces 3 new letters to gather more information.\n\nActually, let me reconsider this. Since we have 6 guesses total and this is only our second guess, we want to maximize information gain. I should try to use completely new letters (except for the confirmed A and misplaced N). \n\nLet's try PLANT:\n- P: New letter to test\n- L: New letter to test\n- A: Known correct letter in correct position\n- N: Known letter in new position\n- T: New letter to test\n\nActually, I think moving N to position 2 is a good move, so let's try SNAIL:\n- S: New letter to test\n- N: Known letter in new position\n- A: Known correct letter in correct position\n- I: New letter to test\n- L: New letter to test\n\nThis gives us good coverage of new letters while maintaining what we know.\n\nActually, one more thought - if we know N is in the word but not in position 4, it could be in positions 1, 2, or 5. Let's pick one of these positions and also introduce more common letters.\n\nSNAIL seems like a good choice. Let's go with that.\nLooking at the feedback from the first guess:\n\nCRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(\u2713) N(-) E(x)\n\nThis tells me:\n- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N is in the word but in the wrong position\n- C, R, and E are not in the word\n\nI need to keep A in the 3rd position and try N in a different position (could be 1st, 2nd, or 5th). I should also introduce new letters to gather more information while avoiding C, R, and E.\n\nA good second guess would be a word that:\n- Keeps A in position 3\n- Tries N in a new position\n- Uses completely new letters for the remaining positions\n\n<guess>SNAIL</guess>"}

It could be in position 4 or 5.\n\nSome possible words that match this pattern:\n- SNACK (but S can't be in position 1)\n- KNAVE (but E is not in the word)\n- SNAKE (but S can't be in position 1 and E is not in the word)\n\nI need to find words that have:\n- N in position 2\n- A in position 3\n- S in position 4 or 5\n- No C, R, E, I, L\n\nSome candidates:\n- GNASP (not sure if this is a valid English word)\n- GNASH\n- SNAP (only 4 letters)\n- SNAG (but S can't be in position 1)\n\nLet me try to think of more 5-letter words with N in position 2 and A in position 3:\n- KNAPP (but this is a proper noun)\n- KNAVE (but E is not in the word)\n- GNASH\n- PNATH (not a common word)\n\nActually, GNASH seems like a good candidate:\n- G is a letter we haven't tried yet\n- N is in position 2 (confirmed)\n- A is in position 3 (confirmed)\n- S is in position 4 (and S is in the word but not in position 1)\n- H is a letter we haven't tried yet\n\nLet me check if there are other possibilities:\n- KNAPS (but K and P are letters we haven't tried yet)\n- WNATS (not a standard word)\n\nLet me reconsider the feedback:\nFrom Guess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(\u2713) N(-) E(x)\n- N is in the word but not in position 4\nFrom Guess 2: SNAIL -> Feedback: S(-) N(\u2713) A(\u2713) I(x) L(x)\n- S is in the word but not in position 1\n- N is in position 2\n\nSo N could be in position 5, and S could be in position 4 or 5. \n\nLet me think of more words:\n- FINALS (6 letters)\n- SNAPS (but S can't be in position 1)\n- ONASY (not a common word)\n- BNAST (not a common word)\n- MEANT (T not confirmed)\n- BEANS (S is in position 5, but B and E not confirmed)\n\nWait, I need to be more careful. From Guess 1, we learned that E is not in the word, so BEANS wouldn't work.\n\nLet me revisit the pattern: ?NA??, where ? can be any letter except those we've confirmed are not in the word.\n\nLet's try GNASH as my next guess. It has:\n- G (a letter we haven't tried)\n- N (confirmed in position 2)\n- A (confirmed in position 3)\n- S (in the word but not in position 1)\n- H (a letter we haven't tried)\n\nActually, let me double-check if GNASH is a valid English word. Yes, \"gnash\" means to grind your teeth together, often in anger or pain.\n\nSo GNASH seems like a good next guess. But let me see if I can think of other options.\n\nWhat about SNAKY? No, S can't be in position 1.\n\nKNAPS? Hmm, I'm not sure if this is a common word.\n\nFINAL? No, it's only 5 letters, and it has L which we know is not in the word.\n\nMaybe TWANG? But W and G are untested, and we know S is in the word.\n\nLet's see... QUADS? No, Q and U are untested, and D and S are in positions we're not sure about.\n\nSNAGS? No, S can't be in position 1, and we're not sure about G.\n\nAlright, I'm going to go with GNASH. It's a valid word and it fits all our constraints.\n\nWait, I just realized that while GNASH fits the constraints, there's a better option: SNAKY. No, that won't work because S can't be in position 1 and Y is untested.\n\nHmm, actually I'm having trouble coming up with viable candidates. Let me try a different approach.\n\nLet's think of words with N in position 2 and A in position 3, and possibly S in position 4 or 5.\n\n- PNACK? Not a word.\n- BNASH? Not a common word.\n- BNAST? Not a common word.\n- KNAPS? Not sure if it's a common word.\n- MNASK? Not a word.\n\nLet me be more systematic:\n\nFor the 1st letter, it can't be C, R, or S. It could be any other letter.\nFor the 4th letter, it can't be N, I. It could be S or any other untested letter.\nFor the 5th letter, it can't be E, L. It could be S or any other untested letter.\n\nSome common starting letters for words: B, D, F, G, M, P, T, ...\n\nLet's try combinations:\n- BNASK? Not a word.\n- DNASH? Not a common word.\n- FNAST? Not a common word.\n- GNASH? This seems valid.\n- MNASK? Not a word.\n- PNAST? Not a common word.\n- TNASH? Not a common word.\n\nGNASH still seems like the best candidate from the ones I've considered.\n\nLet's double-check if there are other common words with N in position 2 and A in position 3.\n\nHmm, actually, I think KNAPS could be a valid word as a plural of KNAP, which means a small hill or the act of breaking stones. But I'm not sure if it's a common enough word for Wordle.\n\nAnother possibility could be SNAKY. No, I already ruled that out because S can't be in position 1.\n\nAlright, I'm convinced GNASH is a good guess. It has N in position 2, A in position 3, and S in position 4, which aligns with the feedback we've received so far.\n\nActually, I just realized that I might be mis-reading the clue. It's possible that the 1st guess had N in the wrong position, so N could also be in positions 1, 3, or 5. And from the 2nd guess, we know N is in position 2. I think my reasoning is correct.\n\nSimilarly, for S, we know from the 2nd guess that it's in the word but not in position 1, so S could be in positions 2, 3, 4, or 5. But since N is confirmed in position 2 and A is confirmed in position 3, S can only be in positions 4 or 5.\n\nSo, my reasoning is correct, and GNASH remains a valid guess based on the feedback.\n\nLet me go with GNASH.\n\nWait, I just thought of another possibility: SNAKY. But S can't be in position 1 from the 2nd guess feedback.\n\nMNASK? Not a valid word.\n\nDNASH? Not a common word.\n\nFNAST? Not a common word.\n\nTNASH? Not a common word.\n\nBNASH? Not a common word.\n\nMaybe KNAVE? But E is not in the word from the 1st guess feedback.\n\nHmm, KNAPS? It could be a plural of KNAP, but I'm still not sure if it's a common word for Wordle.\n\nONAST? Not a common word.\n\nYNASP? Not a common word.\n\nAlright, after considering various possibilities, GNASH remains the most viable option. It's a valid English word and it aligns with the feedback we've received.\n\nSo, my next guess is GNASH.\nLooking at the feedback from my previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(\u2713) N(-) E(x)\n- A is in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- N is in the word but wrong position\n- C, R, and E are not in the word\n\nGuess 2: SNAIL -> Feedback: S(-) N(\u2713) A(\u2713) I(x) L(x)\n- N is in the correct position (2nd letter)\n- A is confirmed in the correct position (3rd letter)\n- S is in the word but wrong position\n- I and L are not in the word\n\nSo I know:\n- The word has pattern ?NA??\n- Contains S and N (with N confirmed in position 2)\n- Doesn't contain C, R, E, I, or L\n- S must be in position 4 or 5 (since it can't be in position 1, 2, or 3)\n\nLooking for words that match this pattern, \"GNASH\" fits well:\n- G (untested letter)\n- N (confirmed in position 2)\n- A (confirmed in position 3)\n- S (known to be in the word)\n- H (untested letter)\n\n<guess>GNASH</guess>"}

I should focus on common letters I haven't tried yet, like S, T, L, I, O, U, P, etc.\n\nSome possible 5-letter words ending with E that don't include C, R, A, N:\n- SPOKE\n- STOLE\n- SUITE\n- SPIKE\n- SMILE\n- DELVE\n- HOIST\n\nHOUSE contains an O, U, S, and H which are all common letters I haven't tried yet, plus keeps the E at the end.\nHowever, HOUSE has a U, and U is less common.\n\nActually, I think \"SUITE\" might not be ideal because it has U, which is less common than other vowels I could test.\n\nI think \"WHILE\" would be good - it tests W, H, I, L and keeps E at the end, all without using any of the letters I know aren't in the word.\n\nActually, I'm not sure if \"WHILE\" is better than testing more common consonants.\n\nLet's try SLOPE - this tests S, L, O, P and keeps E at the end.\n\nWait, actually I think BUILT or HOUSE both utilize some more common letters. Let me try again with HOUSE - it has H, O, U, S, and the confirmed E at the end. This uses several common letters I haven't tested yet.\n\nHmm, but since I have no information about vowels except that A is not in the word, maybe I should try a word with more vowels to get that information.\n\nI think GUIDE would be a good guess. It has G, U, I, D, and keeps the confirmed E. This lets me test 3 new vowels (U, I, and implicitly O since it's not included).\n\nActually, now that I think about it more, since I only have 6 guesses total, I should try to be as efficient as possible. \n\nI think LOUIE would be a good guess - it would let me test L, O, U, I while keeping E at the end.\n\nNo, I made a mistake. \"LOUIE\" doesn't make sense since there's no common 5-letter word with that spelling.\n\nLet me try THOSE - it tests T, H, O, S while keeping E at the end.\n\nHmm, but \"THOSE\" contains O which is repeated in many other common words I might want to guess.\n\nLet's go with \"SLIDE\" - it tests S, L, I, D while keeping E at the end. These are all common letters, and this would give me good information for my next guess.\n\nActually, I think POSIT would reveal a lot with new letters...but that doesn't keep the E at the end which I know is correct.\n\nI'll use \"PLIED\" instead...but that doesn't end with E either.\n\nLet me go with \"MOVIE\" - it tests M, O, V, I while keeping E at the end.\n\nActually, let me try \"STYLE\" - it tests S, T, Y, L while keeping E at the end. Y is less common but S, T, L are all very common.\n\nLet me look at common 5-letter words ending in E that don't contain C, R, A, or N:\n\nOPTIONS:\n- BOISE\n- QUITE\n- HOMIE\n- QUOTE\n-MOVIE\n- SPOKE\n- SWIPE\n- STOVE\n- SPITE\n- WHILE\n- WEDGE\n- THESE\n- THOSE\n- OBLIGE\n- WHOLE\n\nI think \"WHILE\" is a good choice - it tests W, H, I, L (all common letters) and keeps the E in place.\n\nActually, I think I'll go with \"SUITE\" - it tests S, U, I, T (all common letters) and keeps the confirmed E at the end.\n\nActually, no - I should probably avoid U since it's less common. Let me try \"SLIDE\" - it tests S, L, I, D (all common letters) and keeps the confirmed E.\n\nI'm overthinking this. Let me go with \"SLIDE\" for my next guess.\nBased on the feedback from my first guess, I know:\n- The letter E is in the correct position (last position)\n- The letters C, R, A, and N are not in the word at all\n\nFor my second guess, I want to try different common letters while keeping E in the last position. I should focus on testing new consonants and vowels that could be in the word.\n\n<guess>SLIDE</guess>"}

It must be in position 1, 2, or 3.\n- The following letters are NOT in the secret word: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, Q, U, O.\n\nLet's list the letters we've eliminated: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, Q, U, O.\n\nLetters we haven't tried yet: B, F, G, H, J, K, M, P, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nSince we know T is in the word (but not in position 4), we should include it in our next guess, placing it in position 1, 2, or 3. Let's try to use other common letters we haven't tried yet.\n\nPotential next guesses could include:\n- TPMKE (putting T in position 1)\n- PTMKE (putting T in position 2)\n- MPKTE (putting T in position 3)\n\nBut these aren't real English words. Let's think of valid 5-letter words that:\n1. End with E\n2. Include T in position 1, 2, or 3\n3. Don't include any of our eliminated letters\n\nSome possibilities:\n- BPTE (not 5 letters)\n- THYME (H and Y not yet tested, but M already used)\n\nLet me try again. I need a valid 5-letter English word.\n\nWords ending with E and containing T (not in position 4):\n- TASTE (but contains A which is eliminated)\n- TRITE (but contains R which is eliminated)\n- TWINE (but contains N which is eliminated)\n- TABLE (but contains A and L which are eliminated)\n- THEME\n- TEASE (but contains A and S which are eliminated)\n\nTHEME looks promising as it doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nLet's double-check:\n- T: Yes, and it's in position 1 (we know T is somewhere in the word)\n- H: Not yet tested\n- E: Yes, in position 5 (confirmed correct)\n- M: Not yet tested\n- E: Already accounted for\n\nThe word THEME uses E twice (positions 3 and 5), which is possible in Wordle. Let's go with THEME as our next guess.\n\nActually, let me make sure THEME doesn't use any eliminated letters:\n- C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, Q, U, O\n\nNone of these appear in THEME, so we're good.\n\nWait, I realize I've been making an error. The 5th letter is confirmed to be E, not the 4th letter. Let me re-analyze:\n\nGuess 1: CRANE -> Feedback: C(x) R(x) A(x) N(x) E(\u2713).\n- C, R, A, N are not in the secret word.\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nGuess 2: SLIDE -> Feedback: S(x) L(x) I(x) D(x) E(\u2713).\n- S, L, I, D are not in the secret word.\n- E is confirmed to be in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nGuess 3: QUOTE -> Feedback: Q(x) U(x) O(x) T(-) E(\u2713).\n- Q, U, O are not in the secret word.\n- T is in the word but in the wrong position. Since it's in position 4 in QUOTE, it means T could be in position 1, 2, or 3 in the secret word.\n- E is confirmed to be in the correct position (5th letter).\n\nSo my analysis about THEME still holds. The secret word ends with E and has T somewhere in positions 1, 2, or 3. THEME is still a valid guess.\n\nActually, let me make one more check to ensure my reasoning is correct:\n\nIn QUOTE, T is in position 4, and the feedback says T(-), meaning T is in the wrong position. This confirms T is in the secret word but not in position 4. It must be in position 1, 2, or 3 (since we know position 5 is E).\n\nI'm confident THEME is a reasonable guess for our next attempt.\n\nActually, let me look for a few more possibilities:\n\nWords ending with E and containing T in positions 1, 2, or 3:\n- THEME\n- BYTE\n- TYME (not a common English word)\n- TOTE (But this has T in both positions 1 and 3, and we're not sure if T appears twice in the secret word)\n\nBYTE is another valid option. Let's compare THEME and BYTE:\n- THEME: Tests H, M (and confirms the position of T)\n- BYTE: Tests B, Y (and confirms the position of T)\n\nBoth are valid, but let's go with THEME as it's a more common word.\nI need to analyze what we've learned from the previous guesses.\n\nFrom our feedback:\n- The 5th letter is definitely E (\u2713 in all guesses)\n- T is in the word but not in the 4th position (got a - in QUOTE)\n- The following letters are NOT in the word: C, R, A, N, S, L, I, D, Q, U, O\n\nThis means:\n1. The word ends with E\n2. T is in position 1, 2, or 3\n3. Many common letters have been eliminated\n\nI need to find a 5-letter word that:\n- Ends with E\n- Contains T in position 1, 2, or 3\n- Doesn't use any of the eliminated letters\n\nLooking at possible options, THEME seems like a good choice. It:\n- Has T in the first position\n- Introduces new letters H and M\n- Ends with the confirmed E\n- Doesn't use any eliminated letters\n\n<guess>THEME</guess>"}

It has C in the 4th position, which is different from my first guess.\n2. It includes several common letters I haven't tried yet: L, O, G, I.\n3. It's a common word.\n\nBut wait, I need to check if \"LOGIC\" contains any letters I know are not in the word (R, A, N, E).\nL - ok\nO - ok\nG - ok\nI - ok\nC - ok (and needs to be included)\n\nSo \"LOGIC\" looks like a good guess.\n\nActually, let me also consider \"SCOUT\" as it tests S, a very common letter:\nS - ok\nC - ok (and needs to be included)\nO - ok\nU - ok\nT - ok\n\nBoth \"LOGIC\" and \"SCOUT\" are good options. I think I'll go with \"SCOUT\" as my guess because it tests S, which is one of the most common letters in English, and puts C in a different position than my first guess.\n\nActually, let me review a few more options to be thorough:\n\n\"PSYCH\" would test P, S, Y, H - all common letters, with C in a different position.\n\"FOCUS\" would test F, O, U, S - also common letters, with C in a different position.\n\nBetween SCOUT, PSYCH, FOCUS, and LOGIC, I think SCOUT is still a good choice because it tests S in the first position, which is common for 5-letter words.\n\nI'll go with SCOUT as my guess.\n\nActually, let me check one more thing. If I use SCOUT, I'm testing the letters S, C, O, U, T.\nIf I use LOGIC, I'm testing the letters L, O, G, I, C.\nIf I use PSYCH, I'm testing the letters P, S, Y, C, H.\nIf I use FOCUS, I'm testing the letters F, O, C, U, S.\n\nLet me count how many new letters each guess would test:\n- SCOUT: 4 new letters (S, O, U, T) + C\n- LOGIC: 4 new letters (L, O, G, I) + C\n- PSYCH: 4 new letters (P, S, Y, H) + C\n- FOCUS: 4 new letters (F, O, U, S) + C\n\nThey all test 4 new letters plus the C that I know is in the word. The decision comes down to which set of letters I think is most likely to be in the word.\n\nS, T, I, O are among the most common letters in English. \n\nSCOUT tests S, O, U, T - 3 of these are among the most common letters (S, O, T).\nLOGIC tests L, O, G, I - 3 of these are among the most common letters (L, O, I).\nPSYCH tests P, S, Y, H - 2 of these are among the most common letters (S, H).\nFOCUS tests F, O, U, S - 2 of these are among the most common letters (O, S).\n\nBased on this, both SCOUT and LOGIC seem like strong choices. I'll go with SCOUT as my final decision.\n\nWait, I should check if this is a valid English 5-letter word.

So I should avoid using any of these letters in my next guess.\n\nThe letters I know are NOT in the word are: S, T, A, R, E\n\nFor my next guess, I should choose a word that:\n1. Contains 5 completely different letters from my first guess\n2. Uses common letters to maximize my chances of hitting some correct letters\n\nSome common letters I haven't tried yet include:\n- O, I, N (common vowels)\n- L, C, D, P, M, H (common consonants)\n\nLet me think of some valid 5-letter words that use these letters and don't contain S, T, A, R, or E:\n\nCLAIM - has A, which I know is not in the word\nPLUMB - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nCHILD - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nPOLICY - too many letters\nCLIMB - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nCLOUD - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nLUNCH - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nPINCH - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\n\nI think a good strategy is to use as many new common letters as possible. Among the options above, I'll go with \"PLUMB\" because it uses P, L, U, M, B - all of which are relatively common letters and none of which were in my first guess.\n\nActually, let me consider one more option: \"DOING\" - no, this contains I and N but also has G, which is less common.\n\nI think \"PLUMB\" is a good choice for my second guess.\n\nHmm, let me try once more to be sure I'm making an optimal choice. Another common strategy is to use as many vowels as possible. I've already eliminated A and E. The remaining vowels are I, O, and U.\n\nLet me think of a word that uses multiple vowels and common consonants, but doesn't contain S, T, A, R, or E:\n\nPOINT - contains T, which I know is not in the word\nLION - only 4 letters\nPILOT - contains T, which I know is not in the word\nUSING - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nVOICING - too many letters\nGUILD - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nDICOT - contains T, which I know is not in the word\n\nAmong these, \"USING\" and \"GUILD\" seem good. But \"GUILD\" has more common consonants.\n\nBetween \"PLUMB\", \"USING\", and \"GUILD\", I'll go with \"PLUMB\" as it has both a vowel (U) and several common consonants (P, L, M, B) that I haven't tested yet.\n\nWait, let me check one more time to be sure \"PLUMB\" is a valid 5-letter English word... Yes, it is. It refers to a mass of lead attached to a line, used for indicating a vertical direction or determining depth.\n\nSo my next guess will be \"PLUMB\".\n\nActually, on second thought, let me consider a few more options. I want to maximize information gain, so using a word with more common letters might be better:\n\nCOLIN - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nVIOLIN - too many letters\nBLIND - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nFLICK - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters\nGLICH - doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters (though \"GLITCH\" would be too long)\n\n\"COLIN\", \"BLIND\", and \"FLICK\" all look like good options.\n\nLet me go with \"BLIND\" as it uses B, L, I, N, D - all common letters that I haven't tested yet.\n\nActually, wait. \"GLITCH\" is too long, and I'm not sure if \"GLICH\" is a valid English word. Let me stick with \"BLIND\" as my next guess.\nBased on the feedback from my first guess, I need to choose a word that doesn't contain any of the letters S, T, A, R, or E since they were all marked as not in the word.\n\nFor my second guess, I should use five completely different letters to gather more information about which letters might be in the secret word.\n\nI'll use a combination of common consonants and vowels that I haven't tried yet:\n\n<guess>BLIND</guess>"}

Include the letter I but not in the 3rd position\n2. Not include any of the letters we know are not in the word (S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D)\n3. Try new letters to gather more information\n\nLet's think about common 5-letter words that meet these criteria.\nThe common letters I haven't tried yet are: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nI might want to try a word with I in a different position and include several of the untried common letters.\n\nSome possible words could be:\n- WHICH (I in 2nd position)\n- VOICE (I in 2nd position)\n- POUCH (I in position 4 wouldn't work since we've only confirmed I is in the word)\n- MOCHI (I in 5th position)\n- POINT (wouldn't work because it has N and T which we know aren't in the word)\n- MOVIE (wouldn't work because it has E which we know isn't in the word)\n- FIGHT (wouldn't work because it has T which we know isn't in the word)\n\nLet me think of more options:\n- MUSIC (I in 3rd position wouldn't work as we know I is not in that position)\n- HWICH (not a valid English word)\n- WHICH (I in 3rd position wouldn't work)\n\nI need to be careful to choose a valid 5-letter English word. Let me think of more options:\n\n- COYPU (no I, not a good choice)\n- WHISK (I in 3rd position wouldn't work)\n- PIZZA (no I, not a good choice)\n- JUMPY (no I, not a good choice)\n- HICKS (I in 2nd position)\n- FIZZY (I in 2nd position)\n- QUICK (I in 2nd position)\n- PITCH (I in 2nd position)\n- FILMY (I in 2nd position)\n\nFrom these options, I think \"QUICK\" would be a good guess because:\n1. It includes I in the 2nd position (not the 3rd where we know it doesn't belong)\n2. It doesn't contain any letters we know are not in the word\n3. It tries 4 new letters (Q, U, C, K) which would give us more information\n\nSo my next guess will be \"QUICK\".\n\nWait, I should also consider putting I in other positions like 1st, 4th, or 5th.\n\nOther options:\n- IMPLY (I in 1st position)\n- WHIFF (I in 4th position)\n- KIWI (only 4 letters, not valid)\n- YUMPI (not a valid English word)\n- GYPSY (no I, not a good choice)\n- MICKY (I in 4th position, but this might not be a standard word for Wordle)\n- FISHY (I in 2nd position)\n\nThe word \"FISHY\" seems like a good option too:\n1. It includes I in the 2nd position\n2. It doesn't contain any letters we know are not in the word\n3. It tries 4 new letters (F, S, H, Y)\n\nActually, I just realized \"FISHY\" contains S which we already know is not in the word from our first guess. So \"FISHY\" is not a good option.\n\nLet me reconsider \"QUICK\":\n- Q and K are less common letters\n- It might be more strategic to try more common letters first\n\nHow about \"PICOM\"?\n- Wait, I don't think this is a standard English word.\n\nLet me try \"PYGMY\":\n- No I, so not a good choice.\n\nLet's try \"PICKY\":\n- I in 2nd position\n- P, C, K, Y are all new letters to try\n- These are relatively common letters\n- It's a valid 5-letter English word\n\nSo my next guess will be \"PICKY\".\n\nBut actually, let me check if there are other words that might be better by using I in positions other than 2nd.\n\nFor I in 1st position:\n- ICICW (not a valid word)\n- ICILY (might be a word, but Y is less common)\n\nFor I in 4th position:\n- WHIP (only 4 letters, not valid)\n- CHIEF (I in 3rd position, wouldn't work)\n- CHICK (I in 3rd position, wouldn't work)\n\nFor I in 5th position:\n- FUNGI (might not be a common Wordle word)\n- SUSHI (contains S which we know is not in the word)\n- KIWI (only 4 letters, not valid)\n- WIKI (only 4 letters, not valid)\n- CHILI (I in 3rd and 5th positions, but we know I is not in 3rd position)\n- SWAMI (contains A which we know is not in the word)\n\nI'm struggling to find good 5-letter words with I in positions 1, 4, or 5 that don't include letters we know are not in the word. Let me go back to my previous choice.\n\nSo, I think \"PICKY\" is a reasonable guess:\n1. Includes I in position 2 (not position 3 where we know it's not)\n2. Doesn't include any letters we know are not in the word (S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D)\n3. Tries 4 new letters (P, C, K, Y)\n\nI'll go with \"PICKY\" as my next guess.\n\nHold on, let me just make sure this is a valid Wordle word. Yes, \"PICKY\" is a common English word meaning \"fussy or selective\" and should be a valid Wordle word.\n\nLet me actually double-check I'm not missing anything important:\n\nGuess 1: STARE \u2192 S(x) T(x) A(x) R(x) E(x)\nGuess 2: BLIND \u2192 B(x) L(x) I(-) N(x) D(x)\n\nLetters not in the word: S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D\nLetter in the word but in wrong position: I (not in position 3)\n\nUntried letters: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nMy guess \"PICKY\" meets all the criteria:\n- Includes I in position 2\n- Doesn't include any known absent letters\n- Tries 4 new letters\n\nSo I'll go with \"PICKY\" as my next guess.\nI need to analyze the feedback from the previous guesses to make an informed choice.\n\n<think>\nFrom the first guess (STARE), I learned that none of the letters S, T, A, R, or E are in the word.\n\nFrom the second guess (BLIND), I learned that:\n- B, L, N, and D are not in the word\n- I is in the word but not in the 3rd position\n\nSo I know the letters S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D are definitely NOT in the word.\nAnd I know I is in the word, but not in position 3.\n\nLetters I haven't tried yet: C, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n1.

Let's consider the possible letters:\nLetters already eliminated: S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D, P\nRemaining possibilities: C, F, G, H, I, J, K, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nSince I know that I is in the word at position 2, I can eliminate I as a possibility for position 1. Same for C, K, and Y which are already correctly placed.\n\nSo the first letter could be: F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nLet me try to think of valid 5-letter English words that match the pattern _ICKY and don't contain any of the eliminated letters:\n\nFICKY - I'm not sure if this is a valid English word.\nGICKY - I'm not sure if this is a valid English word.\nHICKY - This could be a valid word (hickey without the 'e').\nMICKY - This is a name (Mickey) but spelled differently, I'm not sure if it's a valid Wordle word.\nWICKY - I'm not sure if this is a valid English word.\n\nLet me think about some common words that end with \"ICKY\":\nSTICKY - this has 'T' which is eliminated\nTRICKY - this has 'T' and 'R' which are eliminated\nPICKY - we already guessed this and 'P' is not in the word\n\nI think \"HICKY\" might be a valid Wordle answer. It's a colloquial term for a hickey (a mark caused by kissing), and it fits our pattern _ICKY where the first letter isn't one of our eliminated letters.\n\nActually, I should double check if \"HICKY\" is a valid English word and would be in the Wordle dictionary. I'm second-guessing myself now. Let me think of other possibilities...\n\nVICKY - This is a name, but might not be in the Wordle dictionary.\nWICKY - I'm not sure if this is a valid English word.\n\nActually, the most common word that ends with \"ICKY\" is probably \"MICKY\" (as in Mickey Mouse), but I'm not sure if proper nouns are used in Wordle.\n\nOh, I realized there's another common word: \"NICKY\" (a nickname for Nicholas), but that has an 'N' which is eliminated.\n\nWait, I made a mistake. I previously said that \"HICKY\" is a valid word, but the more common spelling is \"HICKEY\". Let me think again...\n\nActually, I think \"HICKY\" might not be a standard English word, at least not one that would be in the Wordle dictionary.\n\nLet me review the possible first letters again: F, G, H, J, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z\n\nThinking about valid 5-letter English words that match _ICKY:\nWHICKY? Not a standard word.\nMICKY? As mentioned, it's a name.\nJICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nGICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nFICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nOICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nQICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nUICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nVICKY? A name, but might not be in the Wordle dictionary.\nZICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\nXICKY? Not a standard word I'm aware of.\n\nHmm, I'm finding it challenging to come up with a valid 5-letter English word that matches _ICKY and doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nLet me reconsider. I might have made an error in my analysis. Let's double-check the feedback from Guess 3:\n\nGuess 3: PICKY -> Feedback: P(x) I(\u2713) C(\u2713) K(\u2713) Y(\u2713)\n\nSo the word does end with \"ICKY\" and the first letter isn't P, S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, or D.\n\nI'm going to try \"WICKY\" as my guess, even though I'm not entirely sure if it's a valid Wordle word. It matches the pattern _ICKY and doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nActually, I should double check my analysis. I know the word has \"I\" in the second position, \"C\" in the third, \"K\" in the fourth, and \"Y\" in the fifth. So the word is _ICKY. I've eliminated S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D, and P as possibilities for the first letter.\n\nLet's check with another candidate: \"MICKY\". It's a variation of \"Mickey\", so it might be a valid Wordle word. It matches the pattern _ICKY and doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nI think \"MICKY\" is the most plausible guess based on the feedback. But I'm still not 100% confident.\n\nLet me think about this from another angle. The Wordle list usually contains common English words. If I can't readily think of a common word that matches _ICKY, it might be a less common word or a variant spelling.\n\nActually, I think \"DICKY\" is a word (as in \"dickey\", a type of shirt front), but it has 'D' which is eliminated.\n\n\"HICKY\" might be a valid word (a colloquial term for a hickey, a mark caused by kissing), and it fits our pattern.\n\nI'm going to go with \"MICKY\" as my final guess, even though I'm not entirely sure if it's in the Wordle dictionary. If \"MICKY\" isn't valid, then \"HICKY\" would be my next guess.\n\nBut wait, I'm not sure if \"MICKY\" is a valid word, and I'm still debating between \"MICKY\" and \"HICKY\".\n\nActually after reflection, \"MICKY\" seems to be a proper noun (as in Mickey Mouse), and Wordle usually doesn't include proper nouns. So I'll go with \"HICKY\" as my guess, even though I'm still not entirely confident.\n\n(Sorry for the extended thinking, just trying to make the best guess!)\n\nActually, I've been overthinking this. Let me just list all the possible 5-letter English words that have the pattern _ICKY and don't contain the eliminated letters:\n\nHICKY - This might be a variation of \"hickey\".\nMICKY - This is a name (Mickey) but spelled differently.\nWICKY - I'm not sure if this is a valid English word.\nVICKY - This is a name, but might not be in the Wordle dictionary.\n\nI'm most confident in \"HICKY\" being a valid word in the Wordle dictionary, so I'll go with that.\n\nOh, I remembered another possibility: \"FINKY\" - as in related to a fink (an informer). But this word has an 'F' in the first position and an 'N' in the third position, which doesn't match our pattern _ICKY. So, it's not a match.\n\nAfter reviewing everything, I'll choose \"HICKY\" as my guess, although I'm still not 100% sure it's a valid Wordle word.\n\nLet me now check if I'm missing something or if there are other valid words that match our pattern.\n\nI'm sure I'm overthinking this, but I want to be thorough.\n\nOk, I think \"HICKY\" is a reasonable guess based on the feedback we have. It matches the pattern _ICKY, with all four letters in the correct positions, and doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\nWait, there's another possibility I haven't considered: \"JICKY\". I think there's a perfume brand called \"Jicky\", but I'm not sure if it's a common enough word to be in the Wordle dictionary.\n\nOk, let's make a decision. Between \"HICKY\", \"MICKY\", \"WICKY\", \"VICKY\", and \"JICKY\", I think \"HICKY\" is the most likely to be a valid Wordle word. It's a variation of \"hickey\", which is a common term.\n\nI'm going to go with \"HICKY\" as my guess.\n\n...\n\nActually, I just had a thought. What if the word is simply \"ICKY\"? Like, the adjective meaning \"disgusting\" or \"unpleasant\"? But that would only be a 4-letter word, not a 5-letter word as required by Wordle.\n\nOk, I'm definitely overthinking this. Here's my final decision:\n\nMy guess is \"HICKY\".\nLooking at the feedback from my previous guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (STARE), I can eliminate S, T, A, R, E from the word.\n\nFrom Guess 2 (BLIND), I can eliminate B, L, N, D, and I see that I is in the word but not in position 2.\n\nFrom Guess 3 (PICKY), I can see that:\n- P is not in the word\n- I is correct in position 2\n- C is correct in position 3\n- K is correct in position 4\n- Y is correct in position 5\n\nSo I know the word follows the pattern _ICKY, where only the first letter is unknown.\n\nLetters eliminated so far: S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D, P\n\nI need to find a valid 5-letter word that has I, C, K, Y in positions 2-5, with a first letter that isn't one of the eliminated letters.\n\nThe most likely candidate seems to be \"HICKY\" (a colloquial term for a hickey).\n\n<guess>HICKY</guess>"}

Let me think specifically of valid English words that end with \"ICKY\":\n\n- MICKY (although \"Mickey\" is more common as a name)\n- VICKY (typically a name)\n- WICKY (not common in English)\n- DICKY (might be considered informal/slang)\n- NICKY (typically a name)\n- RICKY (typically a name)\n- TICKY (not common)\n\nWait, I need to be careful with proper nouns here, as Wordle typically uses common English words, not proper names. Let me think again.\n\nLet's consider \"DICKY\" - this could be a valid guess, but D was already guessed in BLIND and marked as \"not in the word.\"\nSimilarly, N, T, and R were also ruled out.\n\nLooking at more possibilities:\n- FICKY (not a common English word)\n- GICKY (not a common English word)\n- JICKY (not a common English word)\n- MICKY (usually spelled \"Mickey\" as a name)\n- QICKY (not a word)\n- VICKY (typically a name)\n- WICKY (not common)\n- ZICKY (not common)\n\nBased on my knowledge of English vocabulary, there aren't many common 5-letter words ending in \"ICKY\". Let me consider if \"LICKY\" could be a word, but L was also ruled out in BLIND.\n\nLet me think of any other possible first letters: M, F, G, J, Q, V, W, Z\n\nThe most plausible options seem to be:\n- MICKY (although usually spelled \"Mickey\")\n- VICKY (although usually a name)\n- WICKY (not sure if this is a valid English word)\n\nSince we need to guess a valid 5-letter English word, and since Wordle typically uses more common words, I'll go with \"MICKY\" as my guess. It's possible this might be accepted as a spelling variation of \"Mickey\" or as an informal word.\n\nActually, let me double-check if there are any other common words with the pattern \"_ICKY\" that I might be missing.\n\nHmm, there's also:\n- STICKY\n- TRICKY\n- BRICKY\n\nBut S, T, R, and B have already been ruled out.\n\nActually, let me research this a bit more. According to dictionary sources, the most common 5-letter words ending in \"ICKY\" would be:\n- STICKY (but S is ruled out)\n- TRICKY (but T and R are ruled out)\n- PICKY (but P is ruled out)\n\nI'm having trouble thinking of other common English words with this pattern. Let me try to be systematic:\n\nChecking each possible first letter that hasn't been ruled out:\nF + ICKY = FICKY (not a common word)\nG + ICKY = GICKY (not a common word)\nJ + ICKY = JICKY (not a common word)\nM + ICKY = MICKY (variation of Mickey)\nQ + ICKY = QICKY (not a word)\nV + ICKY = VICKY (typically a name)\nW + ICKY = WICKY (not common)\nX + ICKY = XICKY (not a word)\nZ + ICKY = ZICKY (not a word)\n\nAfter careful consideration, \"MICKY\" seems like the most plausible guess, even though it's usually spelled \"Mickey\" as a name. It's possible Wordle might accept this spelling.\n\nWait, actually, in some dialects, \"MICKY\" can be an adjective meaning \"full of micks (Irish people)\" - but this would be considered derogatory, so I'm not sure Wordle would use this.\n\nOther options like \"VICKY\" or \"WICKY\" seem less likely to be accepted as common English words.\n\nActually, I just realized that a common word that fits this pattern is \"DICKY\" (meaning showy or not working well). However, the letter D was already ruled out in \"BLIND\".\n\nI'll go with \"MICKY\" as my guess.\n\nOn second thought, let me pause and check if there are any common English words I might have missed that fit the pattern \"_ICKY\" where the first letter is not S, B, P, H, T, A, R, E, L, N, or D.\n\nWait, I just realized that if we go to formal English dictionaries, one valid 5-letter word that fits our pattern would be \"WICKY\" which can refer to a type of plant or wick-like material.\n\nAnother possibility is \"MICKY\" which, in certain contexts, can be used as an adjective or informal term (though often spelled \"Mickey\" when referring to the name).\n\nGiven the constraints and the need for a valid 5-letter English word, I believe \"WICKY\" is the most reasonable guess at this point. \"MICKY\" could be alternative if \"WICKY\" is deemed too uncommon.\n\nActually, I believe I should clarify which words might be acceptable in Wordle. Wordle typically uses relatively common English words, not obscure terms, proper names, or slang.\n\nI'm genuinely having a difficult time thinking of a common English word that fits our pattern \"_ICKY\" where the first letter is not S, B, P, H, T, A, R, E, L, N, or D. The most common words with this ending (STICKY, TRICKY, PICKY) have first letters that have been ruled out.\n\nLet me go with \"WICKY\" as my guess. It's a term that can refer to a type of plant or wick-like material, and while not extremely common, it might be accepted in the game.\nLooking at the feedback carefully:\n\n- From Guess 1 (STARE), none of these letters are in the word.\n- From Guess 2 (BLIND), B, L, N, D are not in the word, but I is in the word but in wrong position.\n- From Guess 3 (PICKY), P is not in the word, but I, C, K, Y are all in correct positions.\n- From Guess 4 (HICKY), H is not in the word, but I, C, K, Y remain correct.\n\nWhat I know for sure:\n- Letters 2-5 are definitely I-C-K-Y\n- The first letter is not S, T, A, R, E, B, L, N, D, P, or H\n\nSo I need a word with pattern: _ICKY\n\nLet me consider possible first letters that haven't been ruled out:\nF, G, J, M, O, Q, U, V, W, X, Z...\n\nLooking at standard English words that end with \"ICKY\", the most likely candidate would be:\n\n<guess>WICKY</guess>"}

The word contains the letter A, but not in the middle position (3rd position)\n2. The word does not contain C, R, N, or E\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n- Include A, but in a different position (1st, 2nd, 4th, or 5th)\n- Not use any of C, R, N, or E\n- Try to test new letters to gather more information\n\nCommon letters I haven't tried yet include: T, S, I, O, L, P, D, H, U, M, etc.\n\nLet's try a word with A in a different position and several new common letters:\nPossible options include:\n- TALKS (A in 2nd position)\n- PATH (A in 2nd position)\n- PLANT (A in 3rd position - but we know A is not in this position)\n- SOAPY (A in 3rd position - but we know A is not in this position)\n- BLAST (A in 3rd position - but we know A is not in this position)\n- HAILS (A in 2nd position)\n- FAINT (A in 2nd position - but contains N which we know isn't in the word)\n- ABOUT (A in 1st position)\n- ADMIT (A in 1st position)\n- AUDIO (A in 1st position)\n- QUAIL (A in 3rd position - but we know A is not in this position)\n- SMALL (A in 3rd position - but we know A is not in this position)\n- SPOIL (O and I are common vowels to test)\n\nI think \"AUDIO\" would be a good choice because:\n1. It places A in the 1st position (different from the 3rd position in CRANE)\n2. It tests three new vowels (U, I, O) which could be helpful\n3. It tests the letter D which is reasonably common\n\nActually, wait. I realize that \"AUDIO\" has A in the 1st position, but upon second thought, testing more consonants might be more valuable at this stage.\n\nLet's try \"PATIO\" instead:\n1. It places A in the 2nd position (different from the 3rd position in CRANE)\n2. It tests P, T, I, O - all new letters\n3. P and T are common consonants\n4. I and O are common vowels\n\nThis seems like a good choice to maximize information gain.\n\nWAIT! I need to double-check that \"PATIO\" is a valid 5-letter English word. Yes, \"patio\" refers to an outdoor space typically used for dining or recreation, often adjacent to a house.\n\nSo my second guess will be: PATIO\nBased on the feedback from my first guess, I need to analyze what we know so far.\n\n<think>\nFrom CRANE -> C(x) R(x) A(-) N(x) E(x), I can determine:\n- Letter A is in the word but in the wrong position (not 3rd position)\n- Letters C, R, N, and E are not in the word at all\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n1. Include A but place it in a different position\n2. Avoid using C, R, N, and E completely\n3. Test new common letters to gain more information\n\nI need a word with A in position 1, 2, 4, or 5, and filled with new common letters.\nGood candidates might include PATIO, STAID, BATHS, GRASP, etc.\n\nPATIO seems strong because:\n- Places A in position 2 (different from position 3)\n- Tests new common consonants P and T\n- Tests new vowels I and O\n</think>\n\n<guess>PATIO</guess>"}

The word contains 'S' and 'T', but not in the 1st and 2nd positions respectively.\n2. The word does not contain 'A', 'R', or 'E'.\n\nLet me try to form a new word that:\n- Has 'S' but not in position 1\n- Has 'T' but not in position 2\n- Does not use 'A', 'R', or 'E'\n\nPossible positions for 'S': 2, 3, 4, or 5\nPossible positions for 'T': 1, 3, 4, or 5\n\nLet me think of some 5-letter words that meet these criteria...\n\nWords that might work:\n- LIONS (but this has an 'I' and 'O' which I haven't tested yet)\n- COSTS (but this has 'C' and 'O' which I haven't tested yet)\n- LISTS (but this has 'I' which I haven't tested yet)\n- BOAST (but this has 'A' which I know isn't in the word)\n\nActually, I need to be more methodical. Given the constraints, I want to try a word that:\n1. Places 'S' and 'T' in different positions from my first guess\n2. Tests new letters (no A, R, E)\n\nThe word \"PISTOL\" would be good but it's 6 letters. Let me think of a 5-letter word...\n\nI could try \"PISTO\" but I don't think that's a valid English word.\n\nHow about \"MIDST\"? This has:\n- 'M' (new letter)\n- 'I' (new letter)\n- 'D' (new letter)\n- 'S' (in position 4, different from first guess)\n- 'T' (in position 5, different from first guess)\n\nBut I'm not sure if \"MIDST\" is considered a common 5-letter word for Wordle.\n\nAnother option is \"COSTS\":\n- 'C' (new letter)\n- 'O' (new letter)\n- 'S' (in position 3, different from first guess)\n- 'T' (in position 4, different from first guess)\n- 'S' (another 'S', which might be okay if the word has two S's)\n\nLet me go with \"COSTS\" as my next guess.\n\nWait, actually, I should make sure I explore more new letters rather than reusing 'S' twice. \n\nLet me try \"GHOST\":\n- 'G' (new letter)\n- 'H' (new letter)\n- 'O' (new letter)\n- 'S' (in position 4, different from first guess)\n- 'T' (in position 5, different from first guess)\n\n\"GHOST\" is a valid 5-letter English word, and it tests 3 new letters while placing 'S' and 'T' in positions I haven't tried yet.\n\nI'll go with \"GHOST\" as my next guess.\nLooking at the feedback from my first guess:\n\nSTARE -> S(-) T(-) A(x) R(x) E(x)\n\nThis tells me:\n- S and T are in the word but in wrong positions\n- A, R, and E are not in the word\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n1.

So I need to avoid these letters.\n- \"R\" is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- \"E\" is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nSo, I need to find a 5-letter word that:\n1. Contains \"R\", but not in the 4th position (could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 5th position)\n2. Contains \"E\", but not in the 5th position (could be 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position)\n3. Does not contain \"S\", \"T\", or \"A\"\n\nSome possibilities that come to mind:\n- BREED (R in 2nd, E in 3rd and 4th positions)\n- CRONE (R in 2nd, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n- CYBER (C in 1st, Y in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th positions)\n- DROVE (D in 1st, R in 2nd, O in 3rd, V in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n- WHERE (W in 1st, H in 2nd, E in 3rd, R in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know R isn't in 4th position and E isn't in 5th position)\n\nI need to be more careful here. Let me try to find a word that meets all constraints:\n\n- FIBER (F in 1st, I in 2nd, B in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th positions)\n- CRIER (C in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th positions)\n- POWER (P in 1st, O in 2nd, W in 3rd, E in 4th, R in 5th positions)\n\nHowever, I need to double-check that R isn't in 5th position (the feedback only tells us it's not in 4th).\n\nLet me think of more options:\n- BROKE (B in 1st, R in 2nd, O in 3rd, K in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n- PRICE (P in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, C in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n\nThis is tricky. Let me try to think of words where E and R are in different positions:\n- CRIME (C in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, M in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n- BERYL (B in 1st, E in 2nd, R in 3rd, Y in 4th, L in 5th positions)\n- BRIEF (B in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, E in 4th, F in 5th positions)\n\nBERYL and BRIEF look promising. Let me check a few more options:\n- CRIED (C in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, E in 4th, D in 5th positions)\n- PRIDE (P in 1st, R in 2nd, I in 3rd, D in 4th, E in 5th position - but we know E isn't in 5th position)\n\nI think CRIED is a good guess. Let's go with that.\n\nActually, let's double check that CRIED doesn't have the letters S, T, or A, which we know are not in the word.\n- C: not S, T, or A. \u2713\n- R: not S, T, or A. \u2713\n- I: not S, T, or A. \u2713\n- E: not S, T, or A. \u2713\n- D: not S, T, or A. \u2713\n\nWait, I just realized I need to be more careful about \"R\" and \"E\". The feedback says R(-) and E(-), which means R and E are in the word but in the wrong positions. So, I know:\n- R is in the word but not in the 4th position.\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position.\n\nI think CRIED is still a good guess. R is in the 2nd position (not 4th), and E is in the 4th position (not 5th).\n\nLet's go with CRIED.\nBased on the feedback from the first guess, I need to analyze what we know:\n\n- S, T, and A are not in the word (marked with x)\n- R is in the word but not in the 4th position (marked with -)\n- E is in the word but not in the 5th position (marked with -)\n\nI need to pick a word that:\n1. Contains R in a position other than 4th\n2. Contains E in a position other than 5th\n3. Doesn't use any of the letters S, T, or A\n\nLooking at potential candidates, I want to use completely different letters for the remaining positions to gather more information about the secret word.\n\n<guess>CRIED</guess>"}

For the pattern ?R?E?, valid 5-letter words would be:\n- BROKE\n- BRENT (but has T which is not in the word)\n- CREME (but has C which is not in the word)\n- CREPE (but has C which is not in the word)\n- FREAK (but has A which is not in the word)\n- FRESH (but has H in a position where we don't know if it's right)\n- GREEK\n- GROVE\n- PRIZE (but has I which is not in the word)\n- DRONE (but has D which is not in the word)\n- TROVE (but has T which is not in the word)\n\nLet me filter out words that contain known bad letters (S, T, A, C, I, D):\n- BROKE\n- FRESH\n- GREEK\n- GROVE\n- PRONE (but note this has 'N' where E should be, so it doesn't actually match our pattern)\n\nI made an error. Let me recheck. Our pattern is ?R?E?, where ? represents unknown letters.\n\nSome valid possibilities:\n- BROKE\n- FREAK (but has A which is not in the word)\n- FRESH\n- GREEK\n- GROVE\n- PRUNE\n- PROVE\n\nLet me filter again, removing words with S, T, A, C, I, D:\n- BROKE\n- FRESH (still has H at position 5, which we don't know if it's right)\n- GREEK (still has K at position 5, which we don't know if it's right)\n- GROVE (still has G at position 1 and V at position 3, which we don't know if they're right)\n- PRUNE (still has P at position 1, N at position 3, which we don't know if they're right)\n- PROVE (still has P at position 1, O at position 3, V at position 5, which we don't know if they're right)\n\nAll of these are valid guesses since we don't have information about other positions yet.\n\nGiven that we have eliminated quite a few letters already and we want to explore more, I think BROKE or GROVE would be good guesses. They both introduce new letters (B, O, K for BROKE and G, O, V for GROVE).\n\nLet me go with GROVE as my next guess, as it introduces 3 new letters (G, O, V) and keeps the confirmed letters R and E in their correct positions.\nLooking at the previous feedback:\n\nGuess 1: STARE -> S(x) T(x) A(x) R(-) E(-)\nGuess 2: CRIED -> C(x) R(\u2713) I(x) E(\u2713) D(x)\n\nI can determine:\n- R is in the correct position (2nd slot)\n- E is in the correct position (4th slot)\n- Letters S, T, A, C, I, D are NOT in the word\n- R also appears in the word but was in wrong position in first guess\n- E also appears in the word but was in wrong position in first guess\n\nSo I know the word follows this pattern: ?R?E?\n\nI need a word that:\n1.

Does not contain T or R\n\nLet me think of some possible words:\n- SHADE (S is correct, has A and E, doesn't have T or R)\n- SHAPE (S is correct, has A and E, doesn't have T or R)\n- SPACE (S is correct, has A and E, doesn't have T or R)\n- SCALE (S is correct, has A and E, doesn't have T or R)\n- SMOKE (S is correct, has E, doesn't have T or R, but doesn't have A)\n- SNIPE (S is correct, has E, doesn't have T or R, but doesn't have A)\n- SOAPY (S is correct, has A, doesn't have T or R, but doesn't have E)\n- SIEGE (S is correct, has E, doesn't have T or R, but doesn't have A)\n\nLet me consider positioning of A and E more carefully:\n- A can't be in position 3, so it could be in positions 2, 4, or 5\n- E can't be in position 5, so it could be in positions 2, 3, or 4\n\nWords with A in position 2:\n- SABLE\n- SACKS\n- SAGE\n- SAKES\n- SALES\n- SAME\n- SAND\n- SANE\n- SAVE\n\nWords with A in position 4:\n- SHAVE\n- SHAPE\n- SNAKE\n- SPACE\n- SHADE\n- SHALE\n- SHAKE\n- SHAME\n- SPAN\n- SPADE\n\nWords with A in position 5:\n- SALSA\n- SAMBA\n- SODA\n\nWords with E in position 2:\n- SEAL\n- SEAM\n- SEAK (not sure if this is a valid word)\n- SEAN (name, so not appropriate)\n- SEEP\n- SEWN\n\nWords with E in position 3:\n- SIZED\n- SWEAT (contains T, so not appropriate)\n\nWords with E in position 4:\n- SAGES\n- SALES\n- SAVES\n- SAKES\n- SHIED\n- SKIED\n- SPIED\n- SWING (doesn't contain A, so not ideal)\n\nNow, let's look for words that have S in position 1, A in a position other than 3, E in a position other than 5, and don't contain T or R:\n\n- SHADE (S in 1, A in 3 (not valid), E in 5 (not valid))\n- SHAPE (S in 1, A in 3 (not valid), E in 5 (not valid))\n- SPACE (S in 1, A in 3 (not valid), E in 5 (not valid))\n- SCALE (S in 1, A in 3 (not valid), E in 5 (not valid))\n- SABLE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 5 (not valid))\n- SAGE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SANE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SAVE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SAKE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SALE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SAME (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n\nLet me continue this analysis. I realized I have a bug in my logic above \u2013 I said A is not valid in position 3, but the feedback from the first guess is that A is in the wrong position, meaning it could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (so 3 is the wrong position, but that doesn't mean A can't be in position 3 in the actual word).\n\nSimilarly, E could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 in the actual word (5 is the wrong position).\n\nSince I have the first position fixed as S, let me look for words where:\n- S is in position 1\n- A is in a position other than 3 (where it was in the original guess)\n- E is in a position other than 5 (where it was in the original guess)\n- No T or R\n\nI should also note that the feedback provided is for each individual letter in the guess. So for the letter A, it's in the wrong position specifically when it's in position 3, and for E, it's in the wrong position specifically when it's in position 5.\n\nSo, I'm looking for words where:\n- S is in position 1 (since S in position 1 is correct)\n- A is in the word, but not in position 3\n- E is in the word, but not in position 5\n- No T or R\n\nWait, I'm getting a little confused here, and maybe overthinking this. Let's simplify:\n- S is correct in position 1 (\u2713)\n- T is not in the word (x)\n- A is in the word, but the 3rd position is wrong for A (-)\n- R is not in the word (x)\n- E is in the word, but the 5th position is wrong for E (-)\n\nSo, the secret word starts with 'S', contains 'A' (but not in position 3) and 'E' (but not in position 5), and doesn't contain 'T' or 'R'.\n\nLet me list some words that fit these criteria:\n- SABLE\n- SAGE\n- SAKE\n- SALE\n- SAME\n- SANE\n- SAVE\n- SCALE\n- SHADE\n- SHAKE\n- SHALE\n- SHAME\n- SHAPE\n- SPACE\n- SPADE\n\nLet me consider which of these might be most common or most likely to be the secret word. I should also check if there's any overlap in the positions of A and E in these words.\n\nWords where A is in position 2 and E is in position 4:\n- SAGE\n- SAKE\n- SALE\n- SAME\n- SANE\n- SAVE\n\nWords where A is in position 3 (which we know is incorrect):\n- SHADE\n- SHAKE\n- SHALE\n- SHAME\n- SHAPE\n- SPACE\n\nWords where A is in position 4:\n- SCALE\n- SPADE\n\nWord with A in position 5:\n- SABLE\n\nI think it's most strategic to choose a word with A in position 2 and E in position 4, as this covers a common pattern in English words. From these, \"SAKE\" seems like a common and straightforward word. However, to maximize information, I might want to use a word with more unique letters to eliminate more possibilities. Let's try \"SANE\" as my next guess.\n\nOn second thought, I'm re-evaluating. Wordle is a game where each guess should provide maximum information. If I guess SANE, I'm reusing the letters S, A, and E which I already know about. It might be more strategic to use a word that introduces more new letters to gain more information.\n\nSo instead, let me try to find a word that:\n1. Starts with S (this is confirmed correct)\n2. Contains A and E, but not in positions 3 and 5 respectively\n3. Introduces several new letters (not T or R, which I already know are not in the word)\n\nLet's consider:\n- SHADE (introduces H and D, but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong)\n- SHAPE (introduces H and P, but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong)\n- SCALE (introduces C and L, A is in position 4)\n- SPIKE (introduces P, I, and K)\n- SMOKE (introduces M, O, and K)\n\nI'm now considering between \"SCALE\" and \"SMOKE\". SCALE has A in position 4, which might be correct (we just know it's not in position 3). SMOKE introduces more new letters, but it doesn't contain A, which I know is in the word.\n\nGiven these considerations, I think the best strategy is to go with \"SCALE\". It maintains the correct 'S' at the beginning, has 'A' in a different position than before (position 4 instead of 3), and has 'E' in a position different from before (position 5 is wrong, and SCALE has it in position 3). Plus, it introduces two new letters (C and L) to get more information.\n\nHowever, I just realized that in SCALE, E is in position 5, which I know is wrong. So SCALE is not a good guess.\n\nLet me reconsider the options that have E in a position other than 5:\n- SAGE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SAKE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n- SANE (S in 1, A in 2, E in 4)\n\nThese all have the same pattern. I'm leaning towards \"SAKE\" since it introduces K as a new letter, which is common in English.\n\nActually, I should consider other options as well. Let me look for words with 'S' in position 1, 'A' (not in position 3), 'E' (not in position 5), and that introduce as many new letters as possible:\n\n- SANE (introduces N)\n- SNAKE (introduces N and K, but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong)\n- SKIED (introduces K, I, and D, but doesn't contain A)\n- SEED (introduces D, but doesn't contain A)\n- SHEEP (introduces H and P, but doesn't contain A)\n- SHINE (introduces H, I, and N, but doesn't contain A)\n- SPACE (introduces P and C, but A is in position 3 which we know is wrong)\n- SPIED (introduces P, I, and D, but doesn't contain A)\n\nI should also consider words where A is in position 4 and E is in position 3:\n- SPEED (introduces P and D, but doesn't contain A)\n- SLEPT (introduces L and P, but also contains T which we know is not in the word)\n- SWELL (introduces W and L, but doesn't contain A)\n\nI'm now inclined to choose a word that introduces new letters while still respecting the constraints from my first guess. \"SANED\" would be good (it introduces N and D), but I'm not sure if it's a valid English 5-letter word.\n\nLet me try \"SPAED\" \u2013 wait, I'm not sure if this is a real word either.\n\nLet me consider \"SADIE\" \u2013 but S would be in position 1, A in position 2, D in position 3, I in position 4, and E in position 5. But we know E can't be in position 5.\n\nLet me try \"SAHEB\" - wait, I'm not sure if this is a common word either.\n\nI think I'll go with \"SAINE\" - but I need to check if this is a valid English word. I'm not confident it is.\n\nLooking more carefully, I think \"SANE\" is still a good choice. It maintains the correct 'S' at the beginning, has 'A' in a position different from before (position 2 instead of 3), and has 'E' in a position different from before (position 4 instead of 5). Plus, it introduces a new letter (N) to get more information.\n\nActually, wait. Let me make one more consideration for a better guess.\n\nI think \"SHEAF\" might be a good guess. It has S in position 1 (correct), introduces new letters (H, F), and places A and E in different positions (A in position 4, E in position 3).\n\nBut \"SHEAF\" might not be familiar to everyone, so I should use a more common word.\n\nAlright, final decision: I'm going with \"SAGE\".\n- S is in position 1 (correct)\n- A is in position 2 (not position 3, which we know is wrong)\n- G is a new letter\n- E is in position 4 (not position 5, which we know is wrong)\n\nThis seems like a strategic guess given the information I have.\nI need to analyze the feedback from the first guess to make a strategic second guess.\n\nGuess 1: STARE -> Feedback: S(\u2713) T(x) A(-) R(x) E(-)\n\nFrom this feedback, I know:\n- S is correct in position 1\n- T and R are not in the word at all\n- A is in the word but not in position 3\n- E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nI need a word that:\n1. Starts with S\n2. Contains A (but not in position 3)\n3. Contains E (but not in position 5)\n4. Does not contain T or R\n5. Introduces new letters to gain more information\n\nLooking at possible words that match these criteria, I want one that places A and E in different positions and introduces new consonants.\n\n<guess>SAGE</guess>"}

So the first letter is not B, it could be C.\n\nThe 4th and 5th positions are still unknown, but we know they can't be any of the letters we've confirmed are not in the word.\n\nLet's think about what letters could be in positions 4 and 5:\n- Cannot be: S, T, A, R, E, L, O, K, B, Y\n- Possible letters: C (as we know C is in the word but not in position 3), D, F, G, H, I, J, M, N, P, Q, V, W, X, Z\n\nBased on common English words that fit the pattern ?UB?? and include the letter C somewhere, I'm thinking of:\n- CUBIC\n- PUBIC\n\nWait, I'm forgetting that I already know C is in the word but not in position 3. So the word must have C in either position 1, 4, or 5.\n\nIf C is in position 1, then the pattern is CUB??.\nIf C is in position 4, then the pattern is ?UBC?.\nIf C is in position 5, then the pattern is ?UB?C.\n\nSince B and C were both in the \"wrong position\" in guess 2 (BLOCK), and we now know B is in position 3, C can't be in position 5.

Let me understand the feedback I've received so far.\n\nGuess 1: RAISE \u2192 Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(\u2713)\n\nBreaking down the feedback:\n- R(-): The letter R is in the word but in the wrong position.\n- A(x): The letter A is not in the word.\n- I(x): The letter I is not in the word.\n- S(x): The letter S is not in the word.\n- E(\u2713): The letter E is in the word and in the correct position (which is the 5th position).\n\nSo I know:\n1. The word has R somewhere, but not in the 1st position.\n2. The word has E in the 5th position.\n3. The word does not have A, I, or S.\n\nI need to make a new guess. I'll try to include the letters I know are in the word (R and E) and introduce some new letters to test. I should choose a word that places R in a different position than the 1st.\n\nSome potential 5-letter words that end with E and contain R (but not in the 1st position):\n- WROTE (but this has O, which I haven't tested yet)\n- CRANE (but this has A, which I know isn't in the word)\n- DRONE (but this has O, which I haven't tested yet)\n- BROKE (but this has O, which I haven't tested yet)\n- DRIVE (but this has I, which I know isn't in the word)\n- AGREE (but this has A, which I know isn't in the word)\n\nI need to be careful to introduce new letters to test, but also make use of the feedback I've already received.\n\nLet's try \"WROTE\". It places R in the 2nd position, and I get to test W, O, and T as new letters. It also maintains E in the 5th position.\n\nWait, I should be more systematic. Let me think about which common letters I haven't tested yet. I haven't tested: B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z.\n\nFrom these, common letters in English words are: B, C, D, G, H, L, M, N, O, P, T, U.\n\nI'll create a guess that uses some of these common untested letters, places R in a position other than the 1st, and ends with E.\n\nTwo good options are:\n1. WROTE (tests W, O, T)\n2. PRONE (tests P, O, N)\n3. PORCH (wait this doesn't end in E)\n4. CHORE (tests C, H, O)\n5. GROPE (tests G, O, P)\n\nLet me go with \"CHORE\". It places R in the 3rd position, and I get to test C, H, and O as new letters. It also maintains E in the 5th position.\n\nActually, I just realized \"GROPE\" might not be the best word choice for a public platform. Let me go with \"CHORE\" instead.\n\nOn second thought, let's go with \"PRONE\". It places R in the 2nd position, and I get to test P, O, and N as new letters. It also maintains E in the 5th position.\n\nI'll choose \"PRONE\" as my next guess.\n\nHmm, on third thought, let me go with a word that tests more consonants, since the first guess already tested some vowels.\n\nI'll go with \"CORED\". It places R in the 3rd position, tests C, O, and D as new letters, and maintains the E, though it's now in the 4th position.\n\nWait, that's not right. I need to maintain E in the 5th position.\n\nLet me go with \"SHORE\". It places R in the 3rd position, tests S, H, and O as new letters, and maintains E in the 5th position.\n\nActually, I already know S is not in the word from my first guess, so \"SHORE\" isn't optimal.\n\nLet me revisit and go with \"CHORE\". It places R in the 3rd position, tests C, H, and O as new letters, and maintains E in the 5th position.\n\nThis feels like a solid choice given the information I have.\n\nActually, I've been making a mistake. I've been including the letter S in potential guesses, but I already know from the first guess that S is not in the word.\n\nLet me revisit:\n1. WROTE (tests W, O, T)\n2. PRONE (tests P, O, N)\n3. CHORE (tests C, H, O)\n4. BROKE (tests B, O, K)\n5. DRONE (tests D, O, N)\n\nAll of these maintain E in the 5th position and test new letters. I'm going to choose \"PRONE\" because P, O, and N are all common letters in English 5-letter words.\nLooking at the feedback from my first guess:\n\nRAISE \u2192 R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(\u2713)\n\nThis tells me:\n- E is in the correct position (5th letter)\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position\n- A, I, and S are not in the word\n\nFor my next guess, I need to:\n1. Keep E in the 5th position\n2. Try R in a different position\n3. Test some new common letters\n4. Avoid using A, I, and S\n\nI'll try a word that meets these criteria and introduces some frequently used consonants and a new vowel.\n\n<guess>PRONE</guess>"}

Since we got R(-) in the first guess, and R(\u2713) in the second guess, it means there's either:\n1. Two Rs in the word, one in position 2, and another one not in position 1\n2. Just one R in the word, in position 2, and the feedback from guess 1 was highlighting that R should be in position 2, not position 1\n\nI think option 2 is more likely, as words with double letters are less common. So I'll assume there's just one R in the word.\n\nPossible positions we haven't tried for the remaining positions (1, 3, and 4) are the letters:\n- B, C, D, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nLet me think of some common 5-letter words that match ?R??E pattern, avoiding the letters we know are not in the word:\n- BRIDE\n- CRIME\n- DRIVE\n- GRAVE\n- WRITE\n- TRITE\n- BROKE\n- FRAME\n- TRADE\n- CRUDE\n- CRUMB (no, this ends with B not E)\n- CREME\n- TRUCE\n\nI think a word like \"BRIDE\" would be a good next guess because:\n- It matches our pattern ?R??E\n- It uses common letters (B, D, I)\n- Wait, I already know I is not in the word, so BRIDE wouldn't be a good guess.\n\nLet me find another word that doesn't use any of the eliminated letters:\n- BROKE (has O which is not in the word)\n- CREME\n- CRUDE\n- DRIVE\n- FRAME\n- WRITE\n- TRADE\n\n\"CREME\" seems like a good guess, but I'm not sure if it's a common English 5-letter word. Let me check others.\n\n\"CRUDE\" seems like a valid common word. It matches our pattern ?R??E and doesn't contain any of the eliminated letters.\n\"WRITE\" is also a good choice.\n\"DRIVE\" is another good option.\n\"FRAME\" is viable too.\n\nAmong these, I think \"CRUDE\" would give us the most new information, as it uses common letters C, D, and U that we haven't tested yet. Let's go with that.\n\nActually, let me double-check whether CREME is a valid English 5-letter word. I think \"CREME\" might be spelled as \"CREAM\" in English, so let's avoid that.\n\nActually, let me look at some more options:\n- BRIBE (has B twice, and I which we know isn't in the word)\n- BRUTE\n- CRUTE (not sure this is a common word)\n- DRUPE (might be too obscure)\n- FRERE (might be too obscure)\n- GRIME (has I which we know isn't in the word)\n- TRUCE (has C twice)\n- TROVE (has O which we know isn't in the word)\n\nFrom these, \"BRUTE\" seems like a decent option as it matches our pattern ?R??E and uses common letters B, T, and U that we haven't tested yet.\n\nLet me see... \"CRUDE\", \"BRUTE\", \"WRITE\", \"DRIVE\", \"FRAME\" are all decent options.\n\nI'm going to choose \"FRAME\" as my next guess, as it tests four new letters (F, M, A is already tested and found not in the word). Oh wait, I just saw that A is already tested and not in the word. So \"FRAME\" would only test three new letters: F, R, and M.\n\nLet's try \"CRUDE\" instead. It tests three entirely new letters: C, D, and U.\n\nActually, I made a mistake. \"FRAME\" has A, which we know is not in the word. So \"FRAME\" is not a good guess.\n\n\"BRUTE\", \"CRUDE\", \"WRITE\", or \"DRIVE\" would be better guesses.\n\nActually \"WRITE\" has I, which we know is not in the word. So that's not a good guess either.\n\n\"DRIVE\" has I, which we know is not in the word. So that's not a good guess.\n\nFrom the options left, \"BRUTE\" and \"CRUDE\" seem to be the best choices. Both test three new letters.\n\nLet's go with \"CRUDE\" as our next guess.\n\nWait, I just realized I might have been making a logical error. Let me double-check.\n\nFrom Guess 1: RAISE \u2192 Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(\u2713)\n- R is in the word but in the wrong position (position 1)\n\nFrom Guess 2: PRONE \u2192 Feedback: P(x) R(\u2713) O(x) N(x) E(\u2713)\n- R is in the correct position (position 2)\n\nSo R appears only once in the word, and it's in position 2. The feedback from Guess 1 was indicating that R should be moved from position 1 to somewhere else in the word.\n\nLet me revise what we know:\n- The 2nd letter is R (confirmed)\n- The 5th letter is E (confirmed)\n- The letters A, I, S, P, O, N are not in the word\n\nOur word pattern is: ?R??E\n\nSo for positions 1, 3, and 4, we're looking for letters other than A, I, S, P, O, N, and R (since R is already in position 2).\n\nFrom the options I was considering, \"CRUDE\" still seems like a good choice. It matches the pattern ?R??E and doesn't use any of the eliminated letters.\n\nMy next guess will be \"CRUDE\".\nLooking at the feedback so far:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE \u2192 R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(\u2713)\nGuess 2: PRONE \u2192 P(x) R(\u2713) O(x) N(x) E(\u2713)\n\nI can determine:\n- E is definitely in position 5\n- R is definitely in position 2\n- The letters A, I, S, P, O, N are not in the word\n\nSo the pattern is: ?R??E where ? can be any letter except the ones we've ruled out.\n\nI need to try some new letters to gain more information. Good candidates would include common consonants and vowels we haven't tested yet, like C, D, U, T, etc.\n\nLooking at possible words that match our pattern, \"CRUDE\" seems like a strong option. It matches our ?R??E pattern and uses three new letters (C, U, D) that could give us valuable information.\n\n<guess>CRUDE</guess>"}

We haven't explicitly tested M yet. \n\nOther possibilities for the 4th letter could be:\n- F \u2192 BRUFE (not a common English word)\n- G \u2192 BRUGE (not a common English word)\n- H \u2192 BRUHE (not a common English word)\n- J \u2192 BRUJE (not a common English word)\n- K \u2192 BRUKE (not a common English word)\n- L \u2192 BRULE (possible)\n- M \u2192 BRUME (possible)\n- Q \u2192 BRUQE (not a common English word)\n- V \u2192 BRUVE (not a common English word)\n- W \u2192 BRUWE (not a common English word)\n- X \u2192 BRUXE (not a common English word)\n- Y \u2192 BRUYE (not a common English word)\n- Z \u2192 BRUZE (not a common English word)\n\nLooking at this list, BRULE and BRUME seem like the most plausible options among standard English words.\n\nActually, let me check if I missed any feedback. From Guess 1, we know R is in the word but in the wrong position. In subsequent guesses, R is in the correct position (2nd position). So that checks out. \n\nLet me double-check for any other letters. From Guess 1 (RAISE), we know R is in the wrong position, but in Guess 2 (PRONE), it's in the correct position (2nd position). The only letter we haven't fully accounted for is \"R\" being in the wrong position in Guess 1, but that's explained by R being in position 2, not position 1 as in RAISE.\n\nSo the word follows the pattern \"BRU_E\" and the possibilities are BRULE and BRUME (and possibly others I might have missed).\n\nLet's go with BRUME as our next guess.\n\nActually, let me check if there are other common English words that match \"BRU_E\":\n\n- BRULE\n- BRUME\n\nI think these are the most likely candidates in common English. Given the constraints, I'll guess BRUME.\n\nWait, let me double-check if we've tested M before. From the previous guesses (RAISE, PRONE, CRUDE, BRUTE), I don't see M being tested. So BRUME is a valid guess.\n\nActually, one more check. Let me see if there are other possible letters we haven't tried:\n\nFrom our guesses, we know these letters are not in the word:\nA, I, S, P, O, N, C, D, T\n\nLetters we haven't tried:\nB (but we know it's in position 1)\nE (but we know it's in position 5)\nF, G, H, J, K, L, M, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z\n\nI'll stick with BRUME as my guess.\n\nActually, I'm having doubts about whether \"BRULE\" and \"BRUME\" are common English words in the context of Wordle. Let me reconsider. \n\nLet me check if there are other possible combinations for \"BRU_E\" that I might have missed:\n\nBRUFE, BRUGE, BRUHE, BRUJE, BRUKE, BRULE, BRUME, BRUQE, BRUVE, BRUWE, BRUXE, BRUYE, BRUZE\n\nOut of these, I think \"BRUME\" (meaning fog or mist) is a valid English word, and possibly \"BRULE\" (though it's more commonly seen as \"br\u00fbl\u00e9e\" in French).\n\nGiven the constraints and the letters we've eliminated, I'll go with \"BRUME\" as my next guess.\nLet me analyze the feedback so far:\n\nGuess 1: RAISE -> Feedback: R(-) A(x) I(x) S(x) E(\u2713)\n- E is in position 5\n- R is in the word but wrong position\n- A, I, S are not in the word\n\nGuess 2: PRONE -> Feedback: P(x) R(\u2713) O(x) N(x) E(\u2713)\n- R is now correct in position 2\n- E is still correct in position 5\n- P, O, N are not in the word\n\nGuess 3: CRUDE -> Feedback: C(x) R(\u2713) U(\u2713) D(x) E(\u2713)\n- U is correct in position 3\n- R and E remain correct\n- C, D are not in the word\n\nGuess 4: BRUTE -> Feedback: B(\u2713) R(\u2713) U(\u2713) T(x) E(\u2713)\n- B is correct in position 1\n- R, U, E remain correct\n- T is not in the word\n\nSo I have:\n- Position 1: B \u2713\n- Position 2: R \u2713 \n- Position 3: U \u2713\n- Position 4: ? (not A,I,S,O,N,D,T)\n- Position 5: E \u2713\n\nThe word pattern is \"BRU_E\". Looking at possible English words that fit this pattern, \"BRUME\" (meaning fog or mist) seems most likely.\n\n<guess>BRUME</guess>"}

Let me think about possible positions:\n\nA could be in positions 1, 2, 4, or 5 (not in position 3)\nR could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 5 (not in position 4)\nE could be in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4 (not in position 5)\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n1. Use the letters A, R, and E but in different positions\n2. Introduce new letters to potentially find more correct ones\n3. Avoid using S and T (confirmed not in the word)\n\nLet me think of some valid 5-letter words that meet these criteria:\n\nCAPER - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces C and P\nOPERA - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces O and P\nCRANE - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces C and N\nPARED - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces P and D\nUREA - This only has 4 letters, so not valid\nCARED - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces C and D\nRACED - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces C and D\nRACER - This uses A, E, R but has a duplicate R, which might not be optimal\nERASE - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces S (which we know is not in the word)\nLEARN - This uses A, E, R in different positions and introduces L and N\n\nAmong these, I think CRANE would be a good guess. It:\n- Places A in position 3 (different from before)\n- Places R in position 2 (different from before)\n- Places E in position 5 (same position as before, but we know it's not correct, so this is actually not ideal)\n- Introduces C and N as new letters to test\n\nActually, let me reconsider. CRANE puts E in position 5, which we know is wrong. Let me find a word that places E somewhere else.\n\nWhat about PARED?\n- P is a new letter to test\n- A is in position 2 (different from the original position 3)\n- R is in position 3 (different from the original position 4)\n- E is in position 4 (different from the original position 5)\n- D is a new letter to test\n\nThis seems like a good option, as it tests new positions for A, R, and E, and introduces two new letters (P and D).\n\nHowever, I should double-check if there might be an even better option.\n\nCARED also works similarly:\n- C is a new letter to test\n- A is in position 2 (different from before)\n- R is in position 3 (different from before)\n- E is in position 4 (different from before)\n- D is a new letter to test\n\nBoth PARED and CARED are similar in terms of letter placement. The choice between them depends on which new letters I want to test (P vs. C).\n\nI'll go with PARED for my next guess.\n\nActually, before I finalize, let me double-check if PARED is a valid English word. Yes, it is - it means \"to trim or cut away the outer edges.\"\n\nSo my next guess will be PARED.\nBased on the feedback from my first guess, I need to carefully consider what we've learned:\n\n- S and T are not in the word at all (marked with x)\n- A, R, and E are all in the word but in wrong positions (marked with -)\n\nI should use a word that:\n1. Contains A, R, and E in different positions than my first guess\n2. Introduces new letters to potentially identify more correct letters\n3. Completely avoids S and T\n\nPARED would be a good choice because:\n- It places A, R, and E in new positions\n- It introduces P and D as new letters to test\n- It doesn't use any letters we know aren't in the word\n\n<guess>PARED</guess>"}

From guesses 2, 3, and 4, we've confirmed that the last 4 letters of the word are \"ARED\". We need to figure out what the first letter is.\n\nSo far, we've tried:\n- S (not in the word)\n- T (not in the word)\n- P (not in the word)\n- C (not in the word)\n- B (not in the word)\n\nThis means the first letter could be any other letter of the alphabet except for these. Let's try to think of common 5-letter words that end with \"ARED\":\n\n- FARED\n- HARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- JARED (this is a name, might not be accepted)\n- KARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- LARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- MARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- NARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- OARED (related to oars)\n- QARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- UARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- VARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- WARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- YARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n- ZARED (not sure if this is a common word)\n\nLet me check which of these are valid English words:\n\n- FARED: This is a past tense form of \"fare,\" meaning to perform or get along. This is a valid word.\n- HARED: I believe this would be the past tense of \"hare,\" meaning to run like a hare, but it's less common.\n- OARED: This could be an adjective related to oars (like \"six-oared boat\"). It's valid but less common.\n\nAmong these, \"FARED\" seems like the most common and likely word. Let's go with that.\n\nActually, let me double-check a bit more systematically. Let's go through the alphabet and check if there's a valid word starting with each letter followed by \"ARED\":\n\nA: No word (AARED)\nB: No word (BARED) - we already tried this\nC: No word (CARED) - we already tried this\nD: No word (DARED) - Actually, \"DARED\" is the past tense of \"dare,\" so this is valid\nE: No word (EARED) - Actually, \"EARED\" could be valid (as in \"long-eared\"), but it's uncommon\nF: FARED - valid\nG: GARED - Not sure if this is a common word\nH: HARED - As discussed, less common\nI: IARED - Not a common word\nJ: JARED - This is a name, might not be accepted\nK: KARED - Not a common word\nL: LARED - Not a common word\nM: MARED - Not a common word\nN: NARED - Not a common word\nO: OARED - As discussed, less common\nP: No word (PARED) - we already tried this\nQ: QARED - Not a common word\nR: No word (RARED)\nS: No word (SARED)\nT: No word (TARED)\nU: UARED - Not a common word\nV: VARED - Not a common word\nW: WARED - Might be past tense of \"ware\" but less common\nX: No word (XARED)\nY: YARED - Not a common word\nZ: ZARED - Not a common word\n\nFrom this analysis, the most likely candidates are:\n- DARED\n- FARED\n- WARED\n\nGiven that \"DARED\" is a common past tense form of \"dare,\" I'll go with this guess.\n\nActually, let me carefully review the feedback one more time:\n\nGuess 1: STARE -> S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)\nThis means A, R, and E are in the word but in the wrong positions.\n\nGuess 2: PARED -> P(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713)\nThis means A, R, E, and D are all in the correct positions.\n\nWait, there's a discrepancy here. In the first guess, A, R, and E were all marked as being in the wrong positions. But in the second guess, they are marked as being in the correct positions. Let me double-check the positions:\n\nSTARE: Positions - S(1) T(2) A(3) R(4) E(5)\nPARED: Positions - P(1) A(2) R(3) E(4) D(5)\n\nThese letters are in different positions between the two words:\n- A: Position 3 in STARE, Position 2 in PARED\n- R: Position 4 in STARE, Position 3 in PARED\n- E: Position 5 in STARE, Position 4 in PARED\n\nSo it's possible that the feedback is correct. A, R, and E are in the word but were in the wrong positions in STARE, and they are in the correct positions in PARED. \n\nLet's move forward. Based on the guesses so far, we know:\n- The word has the pattern _ARED, where the first letter is not S, T, P, C, or B.\n- Among the possible words, DARED, FARED, and WARED seem most likely.\n\nLet's go with DARED for this guess.\n\nActually, I want to double-check the rules again. We have 6 tries to guess the word, and we've used 4 so far (STARE, PARED, CARED, BARED). So we have 2 tries left. The feedback we've gotten consistently indicates that the last 4 letters are \"ARED\". The first letter is what we're trying to identify.\n\nBased on guesses 2, 3, and 4, the word pattern is _ A R E D.\n\nFrom guess 1, we know S and T are not in the word.\n\nFrom guess 2, we know P is not in the word.\n\nFrom guess 3, we know C is not in the word.\n\nFrom guess 4, we know B is not in the word.\n\nSo the first letter cannot be S, T, P, C, or B. It could be any of the other 21 letters of the alphabet.\n\nLooking at common words, DARED and FARED are strong candidates. Let's go with DARED for this guess.\n\nActually, let me double check once more to ensure I haven't misunderstood something.\n\nGuess 1: STARE -> S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-)\n- S and T are not in the word\n- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions\n\nGuess 2: PARED -> P(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713)\n- P is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D are all in the correct positions\n\nGuess 3: CARED -> C(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713)\n- C is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D are all in the correct positions\n\nGuess 4: BARED -> B(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713)\n- B is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D are all in the correct positions\n\nIn guesses 2, 3, and 4, the pattern \"ARED\" in positions 2-5 is confirmed to be correct. We're just missing the first letter.\n\nSince we've already tried BARED, CARED, and PARED, and received feedback that B, C, and P are not in the word, we can eliminate those. \n\nFrom guess 1, we know that S and T are not in the word.\n\nSo, the first letter cannot be B, C, P, S, or T. This leaves us with options like DARED, FARED, GARED, HARED, JARED, KARED, LARED, MARED, NARED, OARED, QARED, UARED, VARED, WARED, XARED, YARED, ZARED, etc.\n\nAmong these, DARED seems like the most common and likely word.\n\nI'll go with DARED.\n\nActually, let me quickly check if there are any other common words I'm missing:\n- MARED: Not a common word.\n- GARED: Not a common word.\n- HARED: Not a common word.\n- JARED: This is a name, might not be accepted.\n- KARED: Not a common word.\n- LARED: Not a common word.\n- NARED: Not a common word.\n- OARED: Related to oars, but less common.\n- QARED: Not a common word.\n- VARED: Not a common word.\n- WARED: Not a common word.\n- XARED: Not a common word.\n- YARED: Not a common word.\n- ZARED: Not a common word.\n\nFrom this analysis, DARED and FARED seem to be the most likely candidates. Given the context, I think DARED is the more common word.\n\nI'll choose DARED as my guess.\nLooking at the feedback from previous guesses:\n\nGuess 1: STARE -> S(x) T(x) A(-) R(-) E(-).\n- S and T are not in the word\n- A, R, and E are in the word but in wrong positions\n\nGuess 2: PARED -> P(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713).\n- P is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D are all in the correct positions\n\nGuess 3: CARED -> C(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713).\n- C is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D remain in the correct positions\n\nGuess 4: BARED -> B(x) A(\u2713) R(\u2713) E(\u2713) D(\u2713).\n- B is not in the word\n- A, R, E, and D remain in the correct positions\n\nSo far I know:\n- The word has the pattern _ARED\n- The first letter is not S, T, P, C, or B\n- I need to find a common 5-letter word that fits this pattern\n\nCommon possibilities include DARED, FARED, WARED, but DARED (past tense of \"dare\") seems to be the most likely common English word.\n\n<guess>DARED</guess>"}

They could be in positions 2, 4, or 5.\n\nLet me try some possibilities:\n- SMAPH - Not a common English word\n- SLAMP - Not a standard 5-letter word\n- SWAP_ - Missing a letter at the end\n- S_AMP - Could work if I find a letter for position 2\n\nLet me think of common 5-letter words with S in the 1st position, A in the 3rd position, and containing M and P:\n\nSTAMP - This fits all our requirements: \n- S in position 1 (correct)\n- A in position 3 (correct)\n- Has M and P in it (though we'll need to see if they're in the right positions)\n\nThis seems like a good guess. STAMP is a common English word that meets all our constraints.\n\nLet's try STAMP.\nLooking at the feedback from the previous guesses:\n\nFrom Guess 1 (STARE):\n- S is in the correct position (1st position)\n- A is in the correct position (3rd position)\n- T, R, and E are not in the word\n\nFrom Guess 2 (SCAMP):\n- S and A remain confirmed in positions 1 and 3\n- C is not in the word\n- M and P are both in the word but in wrong positions\n\nSo I know:\n- 1st letter must be S\n- 3rd letter must be A\n- The word contains M and P but not in positions 4 and 5\n- T, R, E, and C are not in the word\n\nSince M and P need to be rearranged, and they can't be in positions 4 and 5 where they were in SCAMP, they must be in positions 2 and/or 5.\n\n<guess>STAMP</guess>"}

Let me analyze this.\n\nGuess 1: RAISE\nFeedback: R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-)\n\nThis tells me:\n- R is not in the word\n- A is in the word but not in position 2\n- I is not in the word\n- S is not in the word\n- E is in the word but not in position 5\n\nLetters that are definitely in the word: A, E\nLetters that are definitely not in the word: R, I, S\n\nNow I need to make a new guess that:\n1. Includes the letters A and E but in different positions than my first guess\n2. Doesn't include R, I, or S\n3. Introduces new letters to gain more information\n4. Is a valid 5-letter English word\n\nIn my first guess, A was in position 2 and E was in position 5.\nSo now I should try A in positions 1, 3, 4, or 5, and E in positions 1, 2, 3, or 4.\n\nLet me think of a valid 5-letter word that meets these criteria. I'll try to use common letters that I haven't tried yet, like T, N, L, O, etc.\n\nHow about the word \"CLAVE\"?\n- C: new letter\n- L: new letter\n- A: in position 3 (different from position 2 in the first guess)\n- V: new letter\n- E: in position 5 (same as first guess, which isn't good)\n\nActually, \"CLAVE\" has E in the same position that we know it's not in. Let me try again.\n\nHow about \"CLEAN\"?\n- C: new letter\n- L: new letter\n- E: in position 3 (different from position 5 in the first guess)\n- A: in position 4 (different from position 2 in the first guess)\n- N: new letter\n\n\"CLEAN\" seems like a good guess:\n1. It includes A and E in different positions than my first guess\n2. It doesn't include R, I, or S\n3. It introduces new letters (C, L, N)\n4. It's a valid 5-letter English word\n\nSo my next guess is \"CLEAN\".\nI need to analyze the feedback from my first guess to make an informed second guess.\n\nFrom \"RAISE\" with feedback R(x) A(-) I(x) S(x) E(-), I can determine:\n\n- A and E are in the word but in wrong positions\n- R, I, and S are not in the word\n- A cannot be in position 2\n- E cannot be in position 5\n\nFor my next guess, I should:\n- Include A and E in different positions\n- Avoid R, I, and S completely\n- Try new letters to gather more information\n\nA good strategy would be to place A and E in new positions while introducing several new common consonants.\n\n<guess>CLEAN</guess>"}
