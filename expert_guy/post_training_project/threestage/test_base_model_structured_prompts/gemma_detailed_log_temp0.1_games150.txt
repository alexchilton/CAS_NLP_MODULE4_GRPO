This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common, frequent letters. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels and avoids any letters that could be grayed out easily. It will quickly reveal whether vowels are present and their positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'U'. The yellow letters are 'U', and the gray letters are 'A', 'D', 'E', and 'I'. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, I, and must contain U.

Since 'U' is in the last position, we need to find a combination of letters that fit the remaining four slots, avoiding the gray letters. Considering common letter frequencies and the constraints, I want to prioritize vowels and consonants that haven't been heavily ruled out.

Let's consider words ending in 'U' that might work. 'CRUFT' is a possibility, but 'F' is gray. 'BLUNT' is another possibility, but 'L' is gray. 'SHUNT' is a good option as it uses the yellow letters and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'S' and the fourth letter being 'U'. We know the word *doesn't* contain A, D, E, H, I, N, or T. This significantly reduces the possibilities. The yellow letters are 'S' and 'U', meaning those letters are in the word, but not in the positions we already know.

Given the constraints, I need to find a word that incorporates 'S' and 'U' and avoids the excluded letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'U' is in the fourth position, I want to build around that.

I'll start by trying a word that uses common letters and tests some new positions. 'BLURS' seems like a good candidate. It includes both 'S' and 'U', and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'S', and we have 'U' in the second position. The gray letters are a significant constraint – we can eliminate almost all common letters. The yellow letters are absent, which means we need to focus on building a word around the known 'U' and 'S' positions.

Given the gray letters, and the need to maximize information gain, I want to introduce some common consonants that haven't been ruled out. 'JUMPS' is a strong contender. It uses the 'U' and 'S' in the correct positions, and avoids all the gray letters. It also introduces the common consonants J and P.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ U _ _ S` as the pattern, and we know the word cannot contain A, B, D, E, H, I, J, L, M, N, P, Q, R, or T. This significantly reduces the possible letters. The 'U' is in the second position, and 'S' is in the fifth. This leaves us with a lot of letters to work with, but we can eliminate many.

Since we've already guessed ADIEU, SHUNT, BLURS, QUASH, and JUMPS, we need to avoid those. The gray letters are a large constraint. Let's focus on common vowels and consonants that haven't been ruled out.

Considering the 'U' and 'S' positions, and the eliminated letters, a good starting point would be to try words with common consonants like C, F, G, K, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Let's try a word that utilizes some of the remaining possibilities and tests common letter combinations. ‘CUSPS’ seems like a reasonable choice. It uses the ‘U’ and ‘S’ in the correct positions, and doesn’t include any of the gray letters. </think>

Since there are no yellow letters, we need to strategically place the known 'I' in the third position.  We want to maximize information gain with our next guess.  Considering the constraints, I'll aim for a word with common vowels and consonants.

Let's consider words that contain 'I' and avoid A, D, E, and U.  A good starting point would be to try words with common vowels and consonants that haven't been used yet.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have the pattern `_ _ I _ S`. The gray letters are A, C, D, E, H, P, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities. Since we know 'I' is in the third position, and we need to avoid the gray letters, we can start by considering common vowels and consonants.

The yellow letters are absent, so we don't need to worry about placement constraints beyond the green 'I'.  Let's try to build a word around the 'I' and avoid the excluded letters.

Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to use common consonants and vowels that haven't been ruled out. ‘FORKS’ is a possibility, but it contains a ‘K’ which is not in the grey list. ‘FLIMS’ is another possibility, but it contains an ‘M’ which is not in the grey list.

Let's try a word that utilizes common letters and avoids the excluded letters. ‘BRIMS’ seems like a reasonable choice. It uses common letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters.

Since we have 'B', 'R', 'I', and 'S' already in place, we need to find a letter to fill the fourth slot that isn't in the gray list.

Given the existing letters, and aiming to maximize information gain, I'll try a common vowel. 'O' and 'E' are gray, so let's try 'O'. This will give us `B R I O S`.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `B _ L _ _` as the starting pattern. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'Y', meaning they are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are all the other letters of the alphabet.

Given the 'B' and 'L' are fixed, and 'A' and 'Y' are present but not in those positions, we need to find a combination of letters that fits the remaining slots. Since 'A' and 'Y' are yellow, they can't be in the positions where 'B' and 'L' are.

Let's consider common letters that haven't been ruled out. The remaining letters are F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, V, W, X, Z.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in the remaining slots. Since 'A' and 'Y' are yellow, let's try a word that places them in possible positions.

Considering the constraints, a word like 'BLAZY' is not possible because 'Y' is yellow. However, 'BLANK' is not possible because 'A' and 'Y' are yellow.

Let's try a word with a common vowel like 'O' or 'E' in the second position. Since 'E' is gray, let's try 'O'. 'HOME' is a possible word, but it's been guessed. Let's try 'COAST'. It fits the pattern and doesn't use any gray letters. This is a good, informative guess.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `C O A _ T`. The gray letters are B, D, E, F, I, L, N, R, S, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities. Since we have 'C', 'O', 'A', and 'T' in fixed positions, we need to find a letter to fill the blank that isn't in the gray list.

The remaining letters that could potentially fit are: G, H, J, K, M, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Considering the existing letters and the need to maximize information gain, I want to try a common vowel. 'E' is not allowed, so let's try 'I'. This will give us 'COAIT'.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no yellow or gray letters. This means all letters in the word are currently unknown. The gray letters (A, D, E, I, U) are definitively *not* in the word. Since there are no yellow letters, we can proceed with a strategic guess to introduce new, potentially helpful letters.

Given the lack of constraints, I'll choose a word with common letters that haven't been used yet. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses several frequently occurring letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters. It also provides a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Since 'N' is in the last position, we need to build around that. The remaining slots can only contain letters that aren't A, C, D, E, I, R, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

I want to try to introduce some common vowels and consonants to narrow down the possibilities further. Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try a word with 'L' or 'S' in one of the earlier positions, as these are relatively frequent.

Since we've already guessed ADIEU, we know 'A', 'E', 'I', and 'U' are out. We need to find a word that includes 'D' and avoids those letters.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize placing the 'D' in a position where it's more likely to reveal other letters. Let's try a word with common vowels and consonants. 'CLOUD' seems like a good candidate. It uses 'D' in the correct position, and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in either ‘D’ or ‘O’ (yellow), and we know it *doesn’t* contain A, C, E, I, L, or U (gray). The word has a green letter, which we don’t know yet. We’ve already guessed ADIEU and CLOUD, so those are out.

Since ‘D’ or ‘O’ are in the last position, and we’ve eliminated several common vowels and consonants, let’s try to build a word around those constraints. The yellow letters ‘D’ and ‘O’ must be placed in the last position.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common letters. Let’s try to incorporate the yellow letters into a plausible word. A word like “MODAL” is possible, but we need to consider the green letter. Since we don’t know the green letter, let’s try a word that uses common letters and has a high probability of containing the green letter.

Let’s consider words ending in ‘D’ or ‘O’. ‘WORD’ is a good candidate, but it’s already been guessed. ‘ROAD’ is another possibility. ‘FODD’ is not a valid word.

I will prioritize a word that maximizes the chance of revealing a green letter in the next turn. ‘ROAD’ seems like a reasonable choice. It uses the yellow letters and avoids the gray letters.

Given the lack of constraints, I'll choose a word with common letters that haven't been used yet. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses several frequently occurring letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters. It also provides a good spread of vowels and consonants.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `P _ _ R E`. The gray letters are A, C, D, H, I, N, O, S, U, and W. This significantly reduces the possibilities. Since we have 'P' and 'R' in fixed positions, and 'E' at the end, we need to find letters to fill the middle slots. The yellow letters are absent, so we don't need to worry about them.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize introducing common vowels and consonants to maximize information gain. Let's consider common letter combinations around 'P' and 'R'. The word must contain P, R, and E.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and tests some frequently occurring consonants. 'PLIER' seems like a good candidate. It uses common letters and fits the pattern.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that contains 'A' but not in the last position, and excludes C, D, E, I, N, R, and U. Let's consider common vowels and consonants. Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and avoids the excluded letters. 'BLAST' seems promising. It contains 'A' and doesn't use any of the gray letters. Let's see if it fits the green clue.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `B _ _ S _`. The yellow letter is 'A', meaning 'A' is in the word but not in the third position. The gray letters are C, D, E, I, L, N, R, T, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' is in the word, and it's not in the third position, it must be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position. Given the 'B' in the first position, 'A' can't be in the first position.

We need to find a word that includes 'A', has 'B' in the first position, and 'S' in the fifth position. Let's consider common letters and patterns. The remaining slots are _ _ _ _ _.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's try to build a word around the known letters.

I'll start by trying a word that uses 'A' in a position other than the third, and includes 'S' in the fifth position. 'BASIS' is a possibility, but 'S' is already in the fifth position.

Let's try to build a word that utilizes the 'A' in a position other than the third. 'BARKS' fits the pattern `B _ _ S _` and includes 'A' and 'S'. It also avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ _ E _`. The yellow letters are 'I' and 'S', meaning those letters are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are A, C, D, L, and U – these are definitively *not* in the word.

Given the 'E' in the fifth position, we need to find a word that incorporates 'I' and 'S' and avoids A, C, D, L, U.  Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'E' is fixed, we need to place 'I' and 'S' strategically.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and tests some frequently occurring consonants. 'SHINE' is a possibility, but 'I' is in the wrong spot. 'STIPE' seems promising – it uses 'S' and 'I' and avoids the gray letters. Let's check if it fits the constraints.

If we try 'STIPE', the 'E' is in the correct position. 'I' and 'S' are in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow clues. This means 'STIPE' is incorrect.

Let's try 'RISES'. This uses 'S' and 'I', and the 'E' is in the correct position. 'R' and 'S' are in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow clues. This is also incorrect.

Let's try 'SIREN'. This uses 'S' and 'I', and the 'E' is in the correct position. 'R' and 'S' are in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow clues. This is also incorrect.

Let's try 'SPITE'. This uses 'S' and 'I', and the 'E' is in the correct position. 'P' and 'T' are in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow clues. This is also incorrect.

Okay, I need to think more systematically. The key is to place the 'I' and 'S' in the remaining slots. Let's consider words with 'S' early on. 'SWIRE' is a possibility. It has 'S' in the first position, 'I' in the third, and 'E' in the fifth. The yellow letters 'I' and 'S

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters and a good distribution of vowels and consonants. 'ADIEU' is a strong choice because it uses four common vowels. It will quickly reveal whether any of those vowels are present in the word and their positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'U'. The yellow letters are 'U', and the gray letters are 'A', 'D', 'E', and 'I'. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, I, or have U in any position other than the last.

Since 'U' is in the last position, we need to find a word that fits the pattern `_ _ _ _ U` and avoids the gray letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The remaining slots can be filled with letters that aren't A, D, E, I.

I want to maximize information gain with my next guess. I'll try a word with common consonants and a vowel that isn't in the gray list. 'FLOUR' seems like a good candidate. It uses the yellow 'U' and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of L, O, R, or U (but not all four).
*   It must *not* contain A, D, E, F, I.
*   We've already guessed ADIEU and FLOUR.

Given the yellow letters, I need to build a word that incorporates those letters in positions that aren't the green ones. Since 'L', 'O', 'R', and 'U' are yellow, I need to avoid placing them in the positions where they are already green.

Let's consider words that could potentially use 'O' and 'U' as they are less constrained. I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good starting point would be to try a word with a common vowel and a consonant that hasn't been ruled out.

I'll start with 'CORAL'. It uses 'O' and 'R' from the yellow letters, and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also doesn't contain 'L' or 'U'.</think>

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word starts with O and has a green letter in the third position. The yellow letters are L, R, and U, meaning they are present in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are A, C, D, E, F, I.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that includes L, R, and U, and doesn't contain A, C, D, E, F, or I. The O is fixed in the second position.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since we have L, R, and U, and the word starts with O, some possibilities might involve those letters.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use a word that includes as many of the yellow letters as possible, while avoiding the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is structured as `_ O _ _ S`. The yellow letters are L, R, and U, meaning they are present in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are A, C, D, E, F, I.

This significantly narrows down the possibilities. Since 'S' is in the last position, and 'O' is in the second, we need to find letters that can fit in the first and third positions, avoiding L, R, and U.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate A, C, D, E, F, and I. This leaves us with a smaller pool of potential letters. Let's think about common vowel and consonant combinations that could work.

The word needs to contain L, R, and U, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow letters. Let's try to build a word around these constraints.

I'll start by considering common vowel placements. Since 'O' is fixed, let's explore words where 'U' could be in the first or third position.

If 'U' is in the first position, we have `U O _ _ S`. The remaining letters to place are L and R. This would give us `U O L R S`. This is a plausible option.

If 'U' is in the third position, we have `_ O U _ S`. The remaining letters to place are L and R. This would give us `_ O U L S`. This is also a plausible option.

Given the limited information, and the need to maximize information gain, I'll go with the first option, `UOLRS`. It uses the yellow letters in different positions and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `A I _ E _`. The yellow letter is 'D', so 'D' is not in the word. The gray letters are R, U, and V, meaning those letters are also not in the word.

We need to place 'D' somewhere else, and we have to incorporate it into a valid word. Considering the existing letters and constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters to maximize information gain.

Let's consider possible positions for 'D'. Since 'D' is yellow, it can't be in the 3rd or 5th position. It must be in the 3rd or 4th position.

If we put 'D' in the 3rd position, we have `A I D E _`. The remaining letters are none, so this is not possible.

Therefore, 'D' must be in the 4th position, giving us `A I _ E D`.

Now we need to find a letter to fill the third position. The available letters are none. This is not possible.

Let's reconsider. The yellow letter 'D' must be in the 4th position. So we have `A I _ E D`. The remaining letters are none. This is not possible.

Let's rethink. The yellow letter 'D' must be in the 4th position. So we have `A I _ E D`. The remaining letters are none. This is not possible.

Let's try a different approach. Since 'D' is yellow, it cannot be in the 3rd or 5th position. It must be in the 2nd or 4th position.

If 'D' is in the 2nd position, we have `A D _ E _`. The remaining letters are none. This is not possible.

Therefore, 'D' must be in the 4th position, giving us `A I _ E D`. The remaining letters are none. This is not possible.

I made a mistake. The yellow letter is 'D', so it cannot be in the 3rd or 5th position. It must be in the 2nd or 4th position.

If 'D' is in the 2nd position, we have `A D _ E _`. The remaining letters are none. This is not possible.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and avoids the excluded letters. 'CRUMP' seems like a good candidate. It uses common letters and doesn't include A, D, E, I.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no green letters initially. The yellow letters ('U') must be in the word, but not in the positions we've already tried. The gray letters ('A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'M', 'P', 'R') are definitively *not* in the word.

Given the constraints, I need to find a word that includes 'U' and avoids the excluded letters. I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use common vowels and consonants.

Let's consider words that contain 'U' and avoid the gray letters. Some possibilities include: BLUNT, FUTON, HUNT, LUXUR, etc. Since we don't have any green letters yet, I want to maximize the chance of getting some yellows. ‘BLUNT’ seems like a reasonable choice as it uses common letters and includes the ‘U’.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with 'A' and 'E' in the correct positions. We know the letters D, I, and U are not in the word. This significantly narrows down the possibilities. The previous guess was ADIEU, which included all the grayed-out letters.

Now we need to find a word that uses 'A' and 'E' in their correct positions and avoids D, I, and U. Let's consider common letters and patterns. Since 'A' and 'E' are fixed, we need to find letters that can fit in the remaining slots.

Considering the yellow letters 'A' and 'E', and the gray letters 'D', 'I', and 'U', I'll start with a word that utilizes common consonants and avoids the restricted letters. 'PLANE' seems like a good candidate. It uses 'A' and 'E' in the correct positions and doesn't include D, I, or U.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'E', meaning these letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'D', 'I', 'L', 'N', 'P', and 'U', so these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given the yellow letters, we know the word must contain 'A' and 'E', but not in the first or second positions. This significantly narrows down the possibilities.  Since 'A' and 'E' are present, let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

I want to maximize information gain with my next guess. I should try to place the yellow letters in different positions to see if I can confirm their locations. 'TRACE' is a good candidate as it uses both 'A' and 'E' and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of the yellow letters: A, E, or T.
*   It cannot contain any of the gray letters: C, D, I, L, N, P, R, U.
*   We've already guessed ADIEU, PLANE, and TRACE.

Given these constraints, we need to build a word that incorporates the yellow letters and avoids the gray ones. The remaining letters to consider are B, F, G, H, J, K, M, O, Q, S, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

Since we want to maximize information gain, I'll aim for a word that uses as many of the yellow letters as possible. Let's consider words ending in 'A' or 'E' first.

If we end in 'A', we have to fit 'E' and 'T' somewhere else. A common vowel combination is 'EA'. Let's try a word like 'BEAST'. It uses 'E' and 'T' and avoids the gray letters. However, 'BEAST' is already in the list of guessed words.

Let's try another word ending in 'E'. How about 'FATE'? It uses 'E' and 'T', avoids the gray letters, and isn't in the guessed words. This seems like a good candidate.

If we end in 'T', we have to fit 'A' and 'E' somewhere else. 'HEAT' is a possibility, but it doesn't use all the yellow letters. 'STATE' is another option, but it's already been guessed.

Considering the available letters and the need to maximize information, 'FATE' seems like the best choice for the next guess. It utilizes two of the yellow letters and avoids the gray letters, and it hasn't been guessed before.

Given this, we know the word contains 'A' and 'I', and it *doesn't* contain 'D', 'E', or 'U'.  Since 'A' and 'I' are yellow, they must be in positions where they aren't currently.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.  Since 'A' and 'I' are present, and we want to maximize information gain, I'll try a word that uses common letters and potentially moves the yellow letters to different positions.

'CLAIM' seems like a good candidate. It uses 'A' and 'I', and doesn't use 'D', 'E', or 'U'.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'I', meaning these letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are C, D, E, L, M, and U, so these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given this, we need to build a word that includes 'A' and 'I' and avoids C, D, E, L, M, and U.  Since 'A' and 'I' are yellow, they can't be in the positions indicated by the green letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in different positions to see if we can narrow down the possibilities.

Let's try a word that places 'A' in the second position and 'I' in the fourth: `_ _ A _ I`. This leaves us with the first, third, and fifth positions to fill. We need to avoid C, D, E, L, M, and U.

Okay, let's break this down. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of the letters A, I, or N (from the yellow clues).
*   It cannot contain B, C, D, E, L, M, R, or U (from the gray clues).
*   It must have the letters A, I, and N in positions that are *not* the green positions.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate a large number of common letters. The remaining possibilities are F, G, H, J, K, P, Q, S, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

Since we need to include A, I, and N, and avoid B, C, D, E, L, M, R, U, let's consider words that can fit the pattern. The yellow letters (A, I, N) must be placed in the remaining spots.

Let's try to build a word around the 'N' as the last letter. 'FINN' is a possibility, but 'N' is not in the yellow letters.

Let's consider words that end in 'A'. 'GAIN' is a possibility, but 'I' and 'N' are not in the yellow letters.

Let's consider words that end in 'I'. 'MAIN' is a possibility, but 'A' and 'N' are not in the yellow letters.

Let's consider words that end in 'N'. 'SPAN' is a possibility, but 'A' and 'I' are not in the yellow letters.

Considering the constraints, a good strategy is to try to incorporate as many of the yellow letters as possible while avoiding the gray letters. The word 'PAINT' is a strong candidate. It includes A, I, and N, and avoids the gray letters. The 'T' is yellow, so it fits the constraints.

Since 'I' and 'N' are yellow, they cannot be in the green positions. Let's consider possible arrangements of 'I' and 'N' within the remaining slots.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's think about common letter combinations. 'AN' is a frequent pair.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ A N _ _`. The yellow letters are 'I'. The gray letters are B, C, D, E, F, L, M, P, R, T, U, Y. This means 'I' is not in the word.

Given the 'A' in the second position, and the 'N' in the third, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and avoids the gray letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'I' is out, we need to focus on vowels other than 'A' and consonants that haven't been ruled out.

The remaining letters to consider are: G, H, J, K, Q, V, W, X, Z.

Let's try to build a word around the 'N' and 'A' positions. A common vowel after 'A' is 'E'. Let's try a word like "MANGO". However, 'O' is not in the yellow letters, so that won't work.

Let's try a word with 'O' in it, since 'I' is yellow. We need to place 'O' somewhere. Let's try "CANOE". This fits the pattern `_ A N _ _`. 'O' is yellow, so it's not a good choice.

Let's try "PANIC". This fits the pattern `_ A N _ _`. 'I' is yellow, so it's not a good choice.

Let's try "SANER". This fits the pattern `_ A N _ _`. 'E' is yellow, so it's not a good choice.

Let's try "WANED". This fits the pattern `_ A N _ _`. 'E' is yellow, so it's not a good choice.

Let's try "NANNY". This fits the pattern `_ A N _ _`. 'Y' is yellow, so it's not a good choice.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in an underscore, and the letters A, L, and U are present but not in their original positions. The gray letters are B, D, E, I, S, and T.

Since 'A' is in the word, but not in the first position, and 'L' and 'U' are also present but not in their original positions, we need to build a word around these constraints. The yellow letters (A, L, U) must appear somewhere in the word, but not where they currently are.

Considering the gray letters, we know the word cannot contain B, D, E, I, S, or T.

Let's try to incorporate the yellow letters strategically.  Given the constraints, a word like "FLAUN" seems promising. It uses A, L, and U, and avoids the gray letters.  Let's check if it fits the green letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'I'. The yellow letters are 'I', and the gray letters are A, D, E, and U. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, U, or I.  Since the last letter is 'I', we know the word ends in 'I'.

Now, let's consider the constraints. We need to find a 5-letter word that doesn't use A, D, E, U, or I, and ends in 'I'.  Let's think about common vowels and consonants. 'O' and 'S' are out due to the gray list. 'R', 'T', and 'N' are possibilities.

A good strategy here is to try to place the yellow 'I' in a position where it can be tested effectively. Since we know 'I' is in the word, let's try a word that uses it in a position that might reveal other yellow letters.

Considering these constraints, I'll guess 'STILY'. It uses the yellow letters 'I' and avoids the gray letters. It also has a unique structure. </think>

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in an unknown letter, and the 'A' is in the word but not in the fifth position. We also know that D, E, I, and U are not in the word.  Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  Given that ADIEU has been guessed, we can eliminate those letters.

My strategy here is to try and place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively, and introduce new letters to narrow down the possibilities. I want to avoid repeating letters that are already known to be absent.

Let's try the word 'CRANE'. It uses the yellow 'A', and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also introduces the letters 'C', 'R', 'N', and 'E', which haven't been tested yet.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in either ‘_’ or ‘_’ and the letters ‘A’ and ‘R’ are in the word but not in the positions we initially guessed. The gray letters are C, D, E, I, N, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since ‘A’ and ‘R’ are present, we know the word must contain those letters. We need to place them strategically, considering they are not in their initial positions.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's consider words that can accommodate 'A' and 'R' in positions that aren't the first or second.

A good strategy here is to try to place the 'R' in a position where it's more likely to be confirmed or eliminated. Let's try a word that uses common letters and might help solidify some positions. ‘TRAIN’ was previously guessed, so we can’t use that.

Let’s try a word that uses the ‘A’ and ‘R’ and avoids the gray letters. ‘SHARP’ seems promising. It uses ‘A’ and ‘R’ and avoids C, D, E, I, N, and U.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word starts with 'S' and has a ' _ _ _ _ ' pattern. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'R', meaning they are in the word but not in the positions we've already tried. The gray letters are all the letters *not* in the word.

Given the constraints, we need to place 'A' and 'R' in positions where they aren't already occupied. Since 'A' is yellow, it can't be in the first position. Since 'R' is yellow, it can't be in the second, third, or fourth position.

Let's consider possible positions for 'A' and 'R'.  The most logical approach is to try to build a word around these letters, keeping in mind the excluded letters.

I'll start by trying a word that uses 'A' and 'R' in positions that haven't been ruled out yet. 'SALON' is a possibility, but 'N' is gray, so it's not viable. 'SARAN' is also a possibility, but 'N' is gray.

Let's try a word that leverages the 'S' in the first position and places 'A' and 'R' in the remaining spots. Considering the gray letters, a good candidate is 'STARE'. This word uses 'A' and 'R' in the correct positions, and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

It uses both yellow letters and doesn’t use any gray letters. It also has a relatively common structure. </think>

FULL THINKING:
Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the yellow letters are L and P. The gray letters are A, C, D, I, N, R, T, and U. This means the word cannot contain any of those letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the gray letters are A, D, I, and U. This means we need to find a word that ends in ‘E’ and doesn’t contain A, D, I, or U. Since there are no yellow letters, we need to introduce new letters to the word.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters to maximize information gained. The word needs to be a valid 5-letter word. Considering the ‘E’ at the end, and avoiding the gray letters, a good starting point would be to try words with common consonants in the first few positions.

Let's consider words ending in 'E' that don't use A, D, I, or U. Some possibilities include: FORCE, CRANE, SHINE, PLATE, etc. Since we don’t have any yellow letters, any of these could work. However, I want to maximize information.

I'll go with 'FORCE'. It introduces several new letters and tests common consonants.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'E' and 'I', meaning those letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'A', 'D', and 'U', so those letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that contains 'E' and 'I' and excludes 'A', 'D', and 'U'.  Since we've already guessed 'ADIEU', we know we need to avoid that word entirely.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The presence of 'E' and 'I' suggests a word with potentially similar sounds. I'll try to build a word that utilizes these letters while avoiding the excluded letters.

I'll start with a word that includes 'E' and 'I' and is likely to reveal more information about the placement of these letters. 'SLICE' seems like a reasonable starting point. It uses both 'E' and 'I', and doesn't contain any of the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'E' and 'I', meaning those letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'A', 'D', and 'U', so those letters are definitively *not* in the word.

I'll start with a word that uses 'L' in a likely position and includes 'I'. ‘PILOT’ is a possibility, but it contains a letter already guessed (ADIEU). ‘SLICE’ is also already guessed. Let’s try ‘FLIER’. It includes ‘I’ and ‘L’, ends in ‘E’, and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'D' and 'U', meaning they are present in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'A', 'E', and 'I', so these letters are definitively not in the word.

Given the yellow letters, we know the word must contain 'D' and 'U'. Since 'D' and 'U' are not in the correct positions, we need to place them in the remaining slots. Also, we need to avoid using 'A', 'E', and 'I'.

Considering the constraints, let's try to build a word that incorporates 'D' and 'U' and avoids the excluded letters. A good starting point is to consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

Let's try a word that places 'U' in the second position and 'D' in the fourth position. This gives us a structure like `_ _ U _ D`.

Now, let's think of words that fit this pattern and use common letters. 'CLOUD' immediately comes to mind. It contains 'U' and 'D' in the correct positions, and doesn't use 'A', 'E', or 'I'. It also doesn't use 'D' or 'U' from the yellow letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'D'. We have 'U' in the word but not in the last position. The gray letters are A, C, E, I, L, O. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'U' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  The word cannot contain A, C, E, I, L, or O.

Let's consider common letters and positions. The 'D' at the end is a strong constraint. I want to try to place the 'U' in a position where it can be potentially green in a later guess.

I'll start with a word that includes common consonants and avoids the gray letters. ‘BRUDU’ is not a valid word, but ‘BRUD’ is a valid word. Let’s try to incorporate the ‘U’ into a word that fits the pattern.

Let's consider words ending in A, D, or I. A good starting point would be to try a word that uses common letters and potentially places the yellow letters in different positions. ‘CRIMP’ seems like a reasonable choice. It uses A and P, and doesn’t contain E or U.

Given the existing letters and constraints, we need to find a word that includes S and T, doesn't use C, D, E, I, L, N, or U, and fits the `B R A _ _` pattern.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ _ E _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'D', meaning they are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are 'I' and 'U', so they are definitively not in the word.

We need to incorporate 'A' and 'D' somewhere in the remaining three slots, avoiding 'I' and 'U'.  Since 'E' is already in the last position, we need to consider how to place 'A' and 'D'.

Given the previous guess was ADIEU, we know 'I' and 'U' are out. Let's try to build a word that uses 'A' and 'D' and avoids the gray letters.

A common strategy is to try to place the yellow letters in positions where they are more likely to be correct. Since 'A' and 'D' are yellow, let's try placing them in the second and fourth positions, respectively. This leaves us with `_ A D E _`.

Now we need to find a fifth letter that fits the constraints. It can't be 'I' or 'U', and it can't be any letters we've already tried. Let's consider common consonants. 'B', 'C', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'P', 'Q', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'.

Considering the existing letters and the need for a valid word, 'CRAFT' seems like a strong possibility. It uses 'A' and 'D' in the correct positions, and doesn't use 'I' or 'U'.

FULL THINKING:
Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ _ E _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'D', meaning they are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are 'I' and 'U', so they are definitively not in the word.

We need to incorporate 'A' and 'D' somewhere in the remaining three slots, avoiding 'I' and 'U'.  Since 'E' is already in the last position, we need to consider how to place 'A' and 'D'.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the yellow letters are 'A' and 'D'. The gray letters are C, F, I, R, T, and U. This means the word must contain an 'E' in the fifth position, and it cannot contain 'A', 'D', 'C', 'F', 'I', 'R', 'T', or 'U'.

Given the constraints, I need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters. Let's consider common vowels and consonants. Since 'E' is fixed, I want to place the remaining letters strategically to maximize information gain.

I'll start with a word that includes common consonants and avoids any of the gray letters. 'BLOKE' seems promising. It uses 'L', 'O', and 'K', which aren't in the gray list. Let's test it.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the yellow letters are 'A' and 'D'. The gray letters are all the others. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'E' is in the last position, we know the word ends in 'E'.  We need to place 'A' and 'D' somewhere in the first three positions, avoiding the gray letters.

Considering the yellow letters, 'A' and 'D' cannot be in the first or second positions because they are yellow. This means they must be in the 2nd or 3rd position, or the 3rd or 4th.

Let's think about common letter combinations. The 'E' at the end suggests vowels are likely.

Given the constraints, a good starting point would be to try placing 'D' in the second position and 'A' in the third, as this allows us to test those letters and potentially reveal more information.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. 'O' is not a yellow letter, so it's a good candidate.

A good starting point would be to try a word with 'O' in the second or third position. ‘ROILS’ fits the criteria. It uses ‘I’ in the correct position, avoids the gray letters, and contains the yellow letter ‘I’.

Given the constraints, I need to find a word that includes 'I' but isn't in the last position, and avoids the gray letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'I' is yellow, it can't be in the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or 4th position.

I'll start by trying a word that utilizes the 'I' in a position other than the last. 'CIVIL' is a possibility, but 'L' is gray, so it's out. 'PILLS' is another possibility, but 'L' is gray. Let's try to build a word around the 'I' in the second or third position.

Considering the yellow 'I', I'll aim for a word that utilizes it in the second or third position. I need to avoid A, D, E, L, O, R, U and the letter 'L'.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ I _ _ S`. The yellow letter is 'F', meaning 'F' is not in the word. The gray letters are A, D, E, L, N, O, R, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'I' is in the second position, and 'S' is in the last, we need to focus on filling the first, third, and fourth positions. The 'F' is excluded, so we can't use any words that contain it.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize introducing common letters to maximize information gain. Let's try to include a vowel that isn't 'I' or 'S'. 'E' is a good candidate, as it's frequently used.

Let's consider words that fit the pattern and use 'E' in the first position. Possible words include: PILES, JICES, etc. However, we need to consider the yellow letter 'F'.

Given the existing clues, a good strategy is to try to place the 'F' in a position where it can be ruled out definitively. Since we know 'F' is yellow, let's try to create a word that *doesn't* contain 'F'.

I'll go with a word that includes a common consonant and a vowel other than 'I' or 'S'. 'C' is a good choice.

Since 'E' is yellow, it must be in one of the last two positions. Considering the 'A' and 'I' are fixed, we need to find a combination of letters that fits the constraints.

Let's think about common letter combinations. The 'E' could be in the 2nd or 4th position. If 'E' is in the 4th position, we have `A _ I E _`. The remaining letters to choose from are B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

If 'E' is in the 2nd position, we have `A E I _ _`.

Given that 'D' and 'U' are not in the word, and we need to find a valid word, let's try to build a word around the 'I' in the middle. A common vowel combination is 'AI' or 'EI'. Since 'E' is yellow, let's try placing it in the second position.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'E', and the fourth letter is not 'I', 'A', or 'D'. We also have 'I' as a yellow letter, meaning it's in the word but not in the fourth position. This significantly narrows down the possibilities.

Since 'I' is yellow, it must be in one of the first, second, or third positions. The gray letters (A, D, U) are definitively not in the word.

Given the constraints, I want to try to place the 'I' in a position where it can be confirmed or eliminated quickly. Let's consider words that commonly use 'I' in the first or second position.

A good starting point would be to try a word that utilizes the yellow 'I' in a position that will give us more information. 'SLICE' is a possibility, but it contains a gray letter 'D'. Let's try to avoid that.

Considering the constraints, I'll aim for a word that includes 'I' and doesn't use A, D, or U. I'll also try to place it in a position that will give me more information about the other letters.

Given this, we know the word contains 'A' and 'I', and it *doesn't* contain 'D', 'E', or 'U'.  Since 'A' and 'I' are yellow, they can't be in the positions indicated by the green letters. We need to place 'A' and 'I' in positions where they aren't yellow.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. 'ADIEU' was already guessed, so we can rule out many common words. The remaining letters to consider are those not in the gray list.

I'll start with a guess that utilizes the yellow letters in different positions and avoids the gray letters. ‘CLAIM’ fits the criteria. It contains ‘A’ and ‘I’, and doesn’t contain ‘D’, ‘E’, or ‘U’. The ‘A’ and ‘I’ are not in the green positions, as required.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'I', meaning these letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are C, D, E, L, M, and U, so these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given this, we need to build a word that includes 'A' and 'I' and avoids C, D, E, L, M, and U.  Since 'A' and 'I' are yellow, they can't be in the positions indicated by the green letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in different positions to see if we can narrow it down.

Let's try a word that places 'A' in the second position and 'I' in the fourth: `_ _ A _ I`. This leaves us with the first, third, and fifth positions to fill. We need to avoid C, D, E, L, M, and U.

Considering common letters, let's try 'BRAIN'. It fits the pattern, includes 'A' and 'I', and excludes the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word ends in 'N'. We also know that 'A' and 'I' are in the word, but not in the positions we've tried before. The gray letters are B, C, D, E, L, M, R, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' and 'I' are present, and the word ends in 'N', let's consider common vowel combinations. The word must contain A and I, and cannot contain B, C, D, E, L, M, R, U.

Let's think about words that end in 'N' and can accommodate 'A' and 'I'.  Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try to place 'A' and 'I' in positions where they aren't competing with the yellow letters.

I'll aim for a word that uses the available letters effectively and tests common letter combinations. ‘PAINT’ is a strong candidate. It uses A and I, ends in N, and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `_ O _ _ D`. The gray letters are A, C, E, I, L, N, R, S, T, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities. Since we have 'O' in the second position and 'D' in the last, we need to focus on filling the first and third positions with letters that aren't in the gray list.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize common letters that haven't been tried yet. Let's consider vowels and consonants that are less likely to be in the word based on the gray list.

I'll start with a word that uses common consonants and avoids the gray letters. 'FOBOS' is a possibility, but it contains 'S' which is gray. 'JODED' seems promising. It uses common letters and fits the pattern.

Since 'M' is in the third position and we know 'O' is in the second, we need to consider words that fit this pattern and include 'S' and 'T' somewhere. The remaining slots are 1, 4, and 5.

Your task is to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits all the clues above.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'E' and 'I', meaning these letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'A', 'D', and 'U', so these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that contains 'E' and 'I' and excludes 'A', 'D', and 'U'.  Since we've already guessed 'ADIEU', we know we need to avoid that word entirely.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The presence of 'E' and 'I' suggests a word with a relatively frequent vowel pattern. I want to prioritize revealing more letters with my next guess. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in different positions to see where they go.

I'll try the word 'SLICE'. It uses both 'E' and 'I', and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'E', and the yellow letters are 'I'. This means 'I' is not in the word. We also know that A, C, D, L, S, and U are not in the word.

Given the constraints, I need to find a word that contains 'I' (which is incorrect) but has the 'E' in the last position. Since 'I' is incorrect, I need to rethink my approach. The yellow letters are 'I', so I need to find a word that contains 'I' but is not in the word. This is a contradiction. Let's re-examine the yellow letters. The yellow letters are 'I'. This means the word *does not* contain 'I'.

Now, let's consider the remaining letters and the green 'E'. I need to build a word that fits the pattern `_ _ _ _ E` and avoids A, C, D, L, S, U, and I.

Let's try to use common consonants and vowels. 'R' and 'N' are frequent. How about 'CRANE'? It fits the pattern and doesn't use any of the excluded letters.

The 'I' is fixed in the second position. The 'E' is fixed in the last position. We need to place 'T' somewhere among the remaining three slots. Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Let's think about common letter combinations. Since 'T' is yellow, it can't be in the first or last position.  Let's try to build a word around 'T' in the first or second position.

If we put 'T' in the first position, we have `T I _ _ E`. The remaining letters can be anything but A, C, D, L, N, P, Q, R, S, U, Y.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'I'. The yellow letters are 'I', and the gray letters are A, D, E, and U. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, U, or I.  Since the last letter is 'I', we know the word ends in 'I'.

Now, let's consider the constraints. We need to find a 5-letter word that doesn't use A, D, E, U, or I, and ends in 'I'. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

I'll start with a common vowel and consonant combination that hasn't been tried yet. 'FLINT' seems like a reasonable choice. It uses common letters and fits the constraints.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'I' and 'N', meaning those letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are A, D, E, F, L, T, and U – these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given these constraints, we need to build a word that includes 'I' and 'N' and excludes A, D, E, F, L, T, and U.  Since 'I' and 'N' are yellow, they can't be in the green positions. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

I'll start with a word that utilizes 'N' in a likely position, and then try to fit 'I' in a place where it won't conflict with the yellow letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ I N _ _` with 'S' as a yellow letter and a long list of gray letters. The 'I' is fixed in the second position. The 'N' is fixed in the third position. We need to place 'S' somewhere in the remaining two spots, and avoid all the gray letters.

Given the constraints, let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'S' is yellow, it can't be in the first or last position. Let's try to build around the 'N' and 'I'.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common letters. The word needs to include 'S' and avoid A, C, D, E, F, H, L, P, R, T, U.

Let's try a word that uses 'S' in the fourth position.  'SINKS' is a possibility. It has 'S' in the fourth position, 'I' in the second, and 'N' in the third. It avoids all gray letters.

The yellow letters are none, so we don't need to worry about placing any of those letters. We need to find a letter that isn't in the gray list and can fit into the remaining spot.

Considering the existing letters, a common vowel would be a good choice. Let's try 'O'. This would give us SINKO, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'A'. This would give us SINKA, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'U'. This would give us SINKU, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'E'. This would give us SINEK, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'I'. This would give us SINKI, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'Y'. This would give us SINKY, which isn't a valid word.

Since we've exhausted the vowels, let's consider consonants. Let's try 'B'. This would give us SINKB, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'G'. This would give us SINKG, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'J'. This would give us SINKJ, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'M'. This would give us SINKM, which isn't a valid word. Let's try 'V'.

It seems like we've missed something. Let's re-examine the constraints. We have SINK_. We know A, C, D, E, F, H, L, P, R, T, U are not in the word.

Let's try a word that starts with a common consonant and includes the remaining letters. 'CRANE' seems like a good candidate. It uses 'A' and 'E' in the correct positions, and doesn't include D, I, or U.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with 'A' and 'E' in the correct positions. We know the letters D, I, and U are not in the word. This significantly narrows down the possibilities. The previous guess was ADIEU, which included all the grayed-out letters.

Now we need to find a word that uses 'A' and 'E' in their correct positions and avoids D, I, and U. Let's consider common vowels and consonants. Since 'A' and 'E' are fixed, we need to find letters that can fit in the remaining slots.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `S _ E _ _`. The gray letters are A, C, D, F, H, I, L, N, R, U. This significantly reduces the possible letters. Since there are no yellow letters, we need to strategically place the remaining letters to maximize information gain. Given the 'S' and 'E' are fixed, I want to introduce common vowels and consonants to see if I can narrow down the possibilities. 'TONIC' is a good candidate as it uses several common letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters. It also has 'E' in the correct position.

The 'A' is in the third position. We need to place 'I' and 'R' in the remaining slots, avoiding the gray letters. This means we need to find a word where 'I' and 'R' are not in the first or last positions.

Let's consider common letter combinations. Since 'I' and 'R' are yellow, we need to build a word around them.  A good strategy is to try to place 'R' in the second position, as it's a relatively frequent letter.

Possible words with 'R' in the second position and 'A' in the third:

Let's check if BRAIN fits the current knowledge:

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common, frequent letters. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels and avoids any letters that could be grayed out later. It also tests several common vowel positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ I _ _` and 'E' is yellow. This means 'E' is in the word, but not in the third position. Also, 'A', 'D', and 'U' are not in the word. The existing word was ADIEU, so we know 'E' is present but not in the third position.

Given the 'I' in the third position, and the 'E' being yellow, I need to find a word that incorporates these letters and avoids the excluded letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'E' is yellow, it can't be in the first or last position.

I'll start with a word that uses the 'I' in the third position and includes the 'E' somewhere else. 'SLICE' is a possibility, but it doesn't fit the pattern. 'PIETY' seems promising. It has 'I' in the third position and 'E' in the fourth. Let's check if it fits the constraints.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'E' and 'I', meaning these letters are in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are 'A', 'D', and 'U', so these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that contains 'E' and 'I' and excludes 'A', 'D', and 'U'.  Since we've already guessed 'ADIEU', we know we need to avoid that combination. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The remaining letters to work with are likely to be B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use a word with common vowels and consonants, and to try to place the yellow letters ('E' and 'I') in different positions to see which one is correct.

The word must contain ‘I’ in the second position and ‘S’ in the third position. Considering the green ‘E’ in the last position, we can start building potential words.

Let’s think about common vowel combinations. ‘IE’ is a frequent pattern. Also, we know ‘A’, ‘C’, ‘D’, ‘F’, ‘L’, ‘P’, ‘R’, and ‘U’ are not in the word.

Given the constraints, a good starting point would be to try words with ‘IE’ in the middle. Let's consider words like ‘WISE’ or ‘SIZE’. However, ‘WISE’ doesn’t fit the pattern. ‘SIZE’ doesn’t have an ‘S’ in the third position.

Let’s try to build around ‘IS’ and ‘E’. We need to find letters that fit the pattern and aren’t in the gray list.

I'll try a word that utilizes common consonants and vowels, while respecting the existing letters. ‘BASIC’ is a possibility, but ‘B’ is gray. ‘MUSIC’ is another possibility, but ‘M’ is gray.

Let's go with a word that has a common vowel and consonant combination. ‘SHINE’ is a possibility, but ‘H’ is gray. ‘SLICE’ is already guessed.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word starts with "C" and "H". The remaining slots are open, and we need to avoid all the gray letters. This significantly reduces the possibilities. The gray letters are A, B, D, E, I, L, M, N, P, R, T, U.

Since we have 'C' and 'H' fixed, and no yellow letters, we need to find a combination of five letters that aren't in the gray list and fit the pattern `C H _ _ _`.  Let's think about common vowels and consonants. 'O' and 'Y' are good candidates, but we need to consider which ones are most likely to appear in a word like this.

Given the limited information, a good strategy is to test common vowel combinations. Let's try a word with 'E' in the third position, as 'E' is a frequent vowel. 'CHOKE' is a possibility, but it's not a common word. Let's try 'CHIEF'. It uses common letters and doesn't violate any constraints.

*   We know that A, B, D, E, F, I, L, M, N, P, R, T, U are *not* in the word.

'HOPE' is a possibility, but 'E' is gray, so we can't use it. 'HOST' is another possibility, but 'T' is gray. Let's try to build a word around common vowel/consonant combinations.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and 'A' is a yellow letter, meaning it's in the word but not in the third position. Also, 'D', 'I', and 'U' are gray, so they are not in the word. This means the word must contain 'A' but not in the third position. The last letter must be 'E'.

Now, let's consider the possibilities. Since 'A' is yellow, it can be in the first, second, fourth, or fifth position. Given that the last letter is 'E', we can eliminate the fifth position for 'A'. We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses the yellow 'A' in a valid position.

Let's try to build a word around the 'E' at the end. A common vowel combination is 'EA'. Let's try to incorporate 'A' in the first or second position.

Considering the gray letters, we can rule out many common letters. Let's aim for a word that uses 'A' in a position other than the third. 'CRANE' is a possibility, but 'A' is in the second position, which is valid.

Since 'E' is in the last position, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and includes 'A' and 'N' in the other positions. Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Let's think about common letter combinations. The 'A' and 'N' must be placed in the first three positions. Given the constraints, a good starting point would be to try words with common consonants in the middle.

I'll start with a word that uses 'N' in the second position and 'A' in the third, and avoids the gray letters. 'MANGO' is a possibility, but 'M' is gray. 'PANEL' is another possibility, but 'L' is gray. 'SANER' is a possibility, but 'R' is gray.

Let's try a word that utilizes 'N' and 'A' in the first and third positions respectively, and avoids the gray letters. 'BANJO' is a possibility. 'BANJO' has 'A' and 'N' in the correct positions, and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also has 'E' in the correct position.

Given the yellow letters, I need to consider words that end in A, N, or O.  The gray letters significantly reduce the possible letters. Let's think about common vowels and consonants that haven't been ruled out.

Since 'A', 'N', and 'O' are in the word, and we've eliminated many common letters, I want to try to build a word that uses those letters in a way that gives me more information.  Let's start with a word that includes 'N' and 'O' and see how it plays out.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ O _ _ _`. The yellow letters are A, B, and N, and the gray letters are all the others. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'O' is in the second position, we know the word cannot start with A, B, N, C, D, E, I, M, R, S, U, W, Y, or Z.

Let's consider the remaining letters and how they can fit into the remaining slots. The yellow letters (A, B, N) must be placed in the remaining slots, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow squares.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize using the yellow letters in positions where they aren't blocked by the green letters. I'll start by trying a word that incorporates 'O' and some of the yellows, while avoiding the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of the letters E, I, or L (from the yellow letters).
*   It cannot contain A, C, D, S, or U (from the gray letters).
*   We've already guessed ADIEU and SLICE.

Given the yellow letters, I want to prioritize a guess that tests each of them. Since 'E' is at the end, I'll try to build around that. The letters we *can* use are B, F, G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, R, T, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

Considering the constraints, a good starting point is to try a word with 'L' in the last position, as it's a yellow letter. 'FLINT' seems like a reasonable choice to test the 'L' and potentially the 'I' or 'E' if it appears elsewhere.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no green letters yet. The yellow letters are E, I, and L, meaning they are present in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are A, C, D, F, N, S, T, and U – these letters are definitively *not* in the word.

Given the yellow letters, I need to build a word that incorporates E, I, and L, avoiding the gray letters.  Since we haven't made any guesses yet, I want to maximize the number of new letters revealed. A good strategy is to use common vowels and consonants.

Let's consider words that contain E, I, and L.  'RELIC' immediately comes to mind. It uses all three yellow letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters. It also fits the pattern of having no green letters.

The yellow letters are none, so we don't need to worry about those. We need to build a word that avoids all the gray letters.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters that haven't been ruled out. Let's try to incorporate some vowels that haven't been used yet. 'O' and 'Y' are possibilities.

Let's start with a word that uses common consonants and a vowel that isn't in the gray list. 'BELOW' is a possibility, but 'B' is gray. 'HELLO' is also a possibility, but 'H' is gray.

Let's try a word with 'O' and 'Y'. 'PELIC' is a possibility, but 'C' and 'R' are gray.

Let's try to build a word around the 'L' and 'E' and avoid the gray letters. 'MELON' is a possibility, but 'N' is gray.

Given the limited information, I'll go with a word that uses common letters and avoids the gray letters. 'ZEBRA' is not a good choice because 'Z' is gray. 'LEVER' is not a good choice because 'R' is gray.

Your task is to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits all the clues above.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word where the last letter is not A, E, D, I, or U. We also know that 'A' and 'E' are present in the word, but not in the positions we initially guessed. This significantly narrows down the possibilities.

Since 'A' and 'E' are present, and we've already guessed ADIEU, we need to find a word that uses those letters and avoids the gray letters. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'E', so we need to incorporate them into a new guess.

Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. A good starting point would be to try to place 'A' and 'E' in positions where they are more likely to be correct based on the yellow letters.

Given the constraints, a word like "PLANE" or "TRACE" could be possibilities, but let's prioritize revealing more information. I'll go with a word that includes common consonants and potentially tests the placement of the yellow letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ A _ E`. The yellow letter is 'P', meaning 'P' is not in the word. The gray letters are D, I, L, N, and U. We've already guessed ADIEU and PLANE.

Given the structure `_ _ A _ E`, we need to find a word that includes 'P' somewhere else, avoids the gray letters, and fits the pattern. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'A' is fixed in the third position, and 'E' is fixed in the last, we need to place 'P' in one of the first two positions.

Considering the constraints, let's try to build a word around common letters. 'RAPER' is a possibility, but we need to check if it's a valid word. It is! It includes 'P' in the first position, avoids the gray letters, and fits the green and yellow clues perfectly.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ A _ E`. The yellow letter is 'P', so 'P' cannot be in the word. The gray letters are D, I, L, N, R, U, meaning those letters are not in the word. We need to find a word that fits this pattern and includes 'P' in one of the remaining slots.

Considering the constraints, let's think about common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'A' and 'E' are fixed, and 'P' is a possibility, let's try to build a word around those letters.

I'll start by considering words that frequently use 'P' in the middle or towards the end. 'SPACE' is a possibility, but 'P' is yellow, so it's out. 'CRAPE' is another possibility, but 'R' is gray. 'MAPE' is a possibility.

Let's try a word that uses 'P' in the second position. 'TAPES' is a good candidate. It uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so it's not correct.

Let's try 'CAPES'. This word uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so it's not correct.

Let's try 'PAPES'. This word uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so it's not correct.

Let's try 'RAPES'. This word uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so it's not correct.

Let's try 'TAPES'. This word uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so it's not correct.

I need to rethink my approach. The yellow letter 'P' is a key constraint. Since 'P' is yellow, it must be in one of the remaining slots, but not in the position indicated by the yellow clue.

Let's consider words with 'P' in the first or third position. 'PASTE' is a possibility. It uses 'A', 'E', and 'P' in the correct positions. 'P' is yellow, so

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ A _ _` with 'C' as a yellow letter and D, E, F, I, N, R, T, and U as gray letters. This means 'C' is not in the word. The 'A' is in the third position. We need to find a word that includes 'C' somewhere, but it's not in the third position. Also, we know the word doesn't contain D, E, F, I, N, R, T, or U.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize using the yellow letter 'C' and avoiding the gray letters. Let's think about common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'A' is already present, and we need to place 'C' somewhere, let's try a word that utilizes common consonants.

'CHAPS' is a possibility. It includes 'C' and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also fits the pattern `_ _ A _ _`.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ A _ S`. The yellow letter is 'C', meaning 'C' is not in the word. The gray letters are D, E, F, H, I, N, P, R, T, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' is in the third position, and 'S' is in the last, we need to find letters that can fit in the first and second positions, avoiding 'C' and the gray letters. Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize common letters to maximize information gain.

Let's consider common consonants that haven't been ruled out. 'B', 'G', 'J', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'Q', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z'.

Given the existing letters and the constraints, a good starting point would be to try a word with a common vowel in the first position. 'LOAS' is not a valid word. 'JAZS' is not a valid word. 'BLAS' is a valid word, but 'C' is yellow.

Let's try 'GLAS'. It uses common letters and places 'C' in the yellow position, which is not in the word. This will help us eliminate some possibilities.

Let's try to incorporate the yellow letters strategically. Since 'D' and 'P' are yellow, they can't be in the green positions. Let's try to place them in the remaining slots.

Let's try 'SONNE'. 'S' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'TONER'. 'T' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'BONER'. 'B' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'NOVEN'. 'N' is yellow, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'CONEY'. 'C' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'ROZEN'. 'R' is yellow, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'HONEY'. 'H' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'WOMEN'. 'W' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'LONE'. 'L' is gray, so this is not valid.

Okay, I'm struggling to find a word quickly. Let's think about common letter combinations. Since 'E' is in the last position, and 'N' and 'O' are yellow, let's try to build a word around those. The remaining letters can be chosen from the allowed set.

How about 'PHONE'? 'P' is gray, so this is not valid.

Let's try 'ZONE'. 'Z'

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in an unknown letter, and the 'A' is in the word but not in the fifth position. We also know the letters D, E, I, and U are not in the word.  Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  Given that ADIEU has been guessed, we can eliminate those letters.

My strategy here is to try and place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively, and introduce new, potentially useful letters. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses the yellow 'A' and avoids the gray letters. It also tests a common vowel and a common consonant.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ A N _`. The yellow letter is 'C', meaning 'C' is not in the word. The gray letters are D, E, I, R, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' and 'N' are fixed positions, we need to find a word that incorporates 'C' in one of the remaining slots and avoids the gray letters. Let's consider common letter combinations. The 'C' likely needs to be near the beginning or end of the word, given the constraints.

Considering the available letters and the existing guesses, a good strategy is to try a word that uses 'C' in a position where it's likely to be yellow, but could potentially be green if it's in the correct spot.

Let's try 'CHANS'. It uses 'C' and avoids the gray letters. It also fits the pattern `_ _ A N _`.</think>

Given the constraints, we need to build a word around the 'E' and incorporate A, D, and R.  Since 'A' is yellow, it can't be in the first or second position. Similarly, 'D' and 'R' can't be in the first, second, or third positions.

Let's consider common letter combinations. The 'E' is likely to be a vowel.  I want to try to place the yellow letters strategically.

FULL THINKING:
This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters and frequent vowel/consonant combinations. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels. It will quickly reveal whether any of those vowels are present in the word and in the correct positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and 'A' is in the word but not in the third position. Also, 'D', 'I', and 'U' are not in the word. We've already guessed 'ADIEU', so we know 'A' is present but not in the first or fourth position. The last position must be 'E'.

Now we need to place the 'A' in one of the remaining slots. Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in either the second or fourth position. Let's consider the possibilities. If 'A' is in the second position, we have _ A _ E _. We need to place the yellow letter 'A' somewhere else. If 'A' is in the fourth position, we have _ _ A E _.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate many common letters. Let's focus on building a word with the known 'E' in the last position. I want to prioritize using the yellow 'A' to gain more information. A common vowel, and one that hasn't been used, is 'O'. Let's try placing 'A' in the second position and 'O' in the first. This gives us O A _ E _.

Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  Given that ADIEU has been guessed, we can eliminate those letters.

My strategy here is to try and place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively, and introduce new letters to narrow down the possibilities. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses the yellow 'A' and avoids the gray letters. It also tests a few common consonants.

Okay, let's break this down. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of A, L, S, or T (from the yellow letters).
*   It cannot contain B, C, D, E, I, N, R, or U (from the gray letters).

Given the existing guesses (ADIEU, CRANE, BLAST), we know that A, L, S, and T are all present in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow letters. This means we need to find a word that uses those letters, but not in those positions.

Let's consider the remaining possible letters. We can't use B, C, D, E, I, N, R, or U.  This leaves us with the letters F, G, H, J, K, M, O, P, Q, V, W, X, Y, and Z.

Since we have A, L, S, and T, and we need to place them somewhere other than their yellow positions, let's try to build a word around those letters.  The yellow letters are scattered, so we need to be strategic.

I'll start with a word that includes 'T' and 'L' and avoids the other yellow letters. 'FAULT' is a possibility, but it contains 'U' which is gray. 'SALTS' is another possibility, but it contains 'S' which is yellow.

Let's try to create a word that uses the yellow letters in different positions. Considering the constraints, a word like 'TALKS' seems promising. It uses 'T' and 'L' and avoids the other yellow letters.

The word 'FAULT' immediately comes to mind. It fits the pattern `T _ L _ S` and contains the yellow letter 'A' in the second position. It also avoids all the gray letters.

Let's check if 'FAULT' is a valid word and if it aligns with the current knowledge. It is a valid word.

Given the structure `T _ L _ S`, and knowing 'A' is present, we need to consider common letter combinations around 'T' and 'L'. Since 'A' is yellow, it can't be in positions 2, 3, or 4. This means 'A' must be in position 2.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `_ _ N _ E`. The yellow letter is 'A', so 'A' is not in the word. The gray letters are B, D, I, L, P, S, U, and W. We need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Considering the 'N' in the third position, let's think about common vowel combinations. Since 'A' is out, and we need to place it in the remaining spots, let's try to build around that. The 'E' is fixed in the last position.

Given the constraints, a good strategy is to try to incorporate the 'A' into the remaining spaces while avoiding the gray letters. Let's consider words with 'N' in the third position.

I'll start with a word that uses the 'A' in the second position, as it's a common letter. A possible word is 'MANTE'. It fits the pattern `_ _ N _ E` and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'E', and the yellow letters are 'I'. The gray letters are A, C, D, L, S, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'I' is yellow, it's in the word but not in the fifth position. We need to incorporate 'I' into the remaining four slots, avoiding A, C, D, L, S, and U.

Let's consider words that end in 'E' and contain 'I'. Some possibilities include: SPIKE, PIZLE, which are unlikely given the gray letters.

I'll go with a word that uses 'I' in a common position and avoids the excluded letters. 'FINER' seems like a reasonable choice to test the 'I' in the second position and potentially reveal other letters.

Considering the available letters and the existing 'E' and 'L', a good candidate would be a word like 'LEVEL'. However, 'V' is a gray letter, so 'LEVEL' is not a valid option.

Let's try another word. Considering the 'E' in the second position and 'L' in the fourth, and 'D' in the third, we could try 'WELDS'. This uses the yellow letter 'D' and fits the pattern. It also avoids all the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ E L _ _` with 'D' as a yellow letter and A, B, F, I, K, O, R, U, and V as gray letters. This means 'D' is in the word, but not in the first, third, or fifth positions. The 'E' is in the second position, and 'L' is in the fourth position.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ D I _ _` and the gray letters are A, E, and U. We know the word cannot contain A, E, or U. The previous guess was ADIEU, so we can eliminate that word.

Since there are no yellow letters, we need to strategically introduce new letters to the word. The 'D' is in the second position, and 'I' is in the third. This significantly narrows down the possibilities. I want to try to find a common vowel in the remaining slots.

Considering the constraints, I'll aim for a word that utilizes common consonants and avoids the gray letters. Let's try a word with 'O' or 'L' in the fourth or fifth position. 'DOLT' is a possibility, but it doesn't fit the pattern. 'DILF' is another possibility, but it doesn't seem likely.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ D I _ _`. The yellow letter is 'O', and the gray letters are A, E, L, M, U. This means 'O' is not in the word.

The green letters tell us that 'D' and 'I' are in the 2nd and 3rd positions, respectively.  We need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't use A, E, L, M, U, and must contain 'O'.

Considering the constraints, let's think about common vowel combinations. Since 'O' is out, we're likely looking at 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', or 'U'. We know 'I' is in the 3rd position.

Let's try to build a word around 'D' and 'I'.  A good strategy is to test common vowel placements.  Since 'O' is unavailable, let's try placing an 'A' in the 4th position. This would give us `_ D I A _`.

Now we need to find a fifth letter that fits the criteria.  The yellow letter is 'O', so we need to find a word that contains 'O' but doesn't use A, E, L, M, U.

Let's consider words with 'D' and 'I' in the correct positions. 'DOILY' is a possibility. It fits the pattern `_ D I _ _` and contains 'O'. It also doesn't use any of the gray letters.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in the remaining slots, but in different positions. Let's try to incorporate 'O' and 'S' into the remaining slots, keeping in mind they are yellow.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ A C _ _`. The gray letters are D, E, F, H, I, N, R, T, U. This significantly reduces the possible letters. Since we have 'A' and 'C' fixed, we need to find letters that aren't in the gray list to fill the remaining slots.

The yellow letters are none, so we don't need to worry about placement constraints beyond the green letters.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters to maximize information gain. Let's consider words starting with 'C'.  'CABIN' is a possible word, but 'B' is in the gray list. 'CACHE' is another possibility, but 'H' is in the gray list. 'SCALE' is a good option as it uses common letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `P _ A _ E`. The gray letters are D, I, L, N, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities. Since we have 'P', 'A', and 'E' in fixed positions, we need to find letters that can go in the second and fourth positions. The yellow letters are absent, so we don't need to worry about those.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize filling in the remaining slots with common letters to maximize information gain. Let's consider common vowels and consonants. 'O', 'R', 'S', 'T', 'C', 'M', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'Q', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', and 'Z' are all out due to the gray letters.

Let's try to build a word around common letters. Considering the 'A' in the third position, and the 'P' and 'E' in the first and last positions, a word like 'PASTE' is a possibility, but 'E' is already in the correct position.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and tests a few different possibilities. 'PRATE' seems like a good candidate. It uses common letters and doesn't violate any constraints.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `P _ A _ E`. The yellow letter is 'S', meaning 'S' is not in the word. The gray letters are D, I, L, N, R, T, and U. We need to find a word that fits this pattern and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Considering the existing guesses, we can eliminate words containing 'S'.  Also, the 'A' is in the third position. Let's think about common vowel combinations and consonants that could fit.

Since 'S' is out, and we have 'P', 'A', '_', '_', 'E', we need to find a letter to fill the blanks that isn't in the gray list.

Let's try to build a word around common patterns. 'PASTE' is a possibility, but 'S' is yellow, so it's out. 'PLANE' is also out because it's already been guessed.

Let's consider words with 'T' or 'R' in the second or fourth position, as those are the most likely candidates given the yellow clue.

I'll go with a word that uses a common consonant and a vowel that hasn't been heavily tested yet. 'PRATE' is already guessed, so let's avoid that.

I'll try 'PLATE'. It fits the pattern, uses 'S' (which is yellow), and doesn't use any of the gray letters. This should give us a good amount of information about the remaining letters.

The yellow letters are 'A' and 'T', so we know those are in the word, but not in the positions we already know.

The gray letters are B, C, D, E, I, L, N, R, S, U. This means none of these letters can be in the word.

We've already guessed ADIEU, CRANE, and BLAST. This helps us eliminate those letters and words.

Given the constraints, we need to find a word that contains 'A' and 'T' and doesn't use any of the gray letters. Let's consider common consonants and vowels that haven't been ruled out.

A good strategy is to try to place the 'A' and 'T' in different positions to gather more information. Since 'A' is in the second position and 'T' is in the fourth, let's try to build a word around those.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and avoids the eliminated ones. 'FATTY' seems like a reasonable choice. It uses 'A' and 'T' in the correct positions, and doesn't use any of the gray letters. </think>

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ A T _ _`. The gray letters are B, C, D, E, F, I, L, N, R, S, U, Y. This significantly reduces the possible letters. Since 'A' and 'T' are fixed, we need to find letters that can go in the remaining slots.

The yellow letters are none, so we don't need to worry about those. We need to build a word that avoids all the gray letters.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters that haven't been ruled out. Let's try to build around the 'T' and 'A'.  A common vowel is 'O' or 'E', but both are gray. Let's try to use a consonant that isn't in the gray list. 'P' and 'G' are good candidates.

Let's start with a word that includes 'P' and 'T' and fits the pattern. ‘PATTY’ is a possible word, but it contains ‘Y’ which is gray. ‘TAPES’ is also a possibility, but it contains ‘E’ which is gray.

Let’s try ‘PLATE’. It fits the pattern, uses only allowed letters, and hasn’t been guessed. This will give us information about the placement of 'A' and 'T'.</think>

The previously guessed word was 'ADIEU', which used 'A', 'D', 'I', and 'U'. This helps us narrow down the possibilities. We need to avoid 'A', 'I', and 'U'.

Let's try to incorporate 'D' and 'U' into a plausible word. Considering the constraints, a word like 'CLOUD' or 'STUDY' could be possibilities. However, 'CLOUD' has a 'C' which is not in the gray list. 'STUDY' has a 'S' which is in the gray list.

Since 'G' is in the fourth position, we know the word doesn't start with A, E, F, I, J, L, or N.  Also, we know 'D' and 'U' are not in the word.

Let's consider possible letters for the first position. It can't be A, E, F, I, J, L, or N.  Let's try to build around 'G' and the yellow letters.

If we try to place 'D' and 'U' in the remaining slots, we'd have something like _ D U G _. This doesn't seem immediately promising.

Let's think about common letter combinations. 'G' is often followed by vowels. Let's try a vowel in the second position. If we put 'O' in the second position, we have _ D U G O.  This is a possibility.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that starts with 'C', contains 'A', and doesn't use D, E, I, N, R, or U.  Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'A' is already placed, we need to fill the remaining spots with letters that aren't in the gray list.

Since 'A' and 'S' are yellow, we can eliminate any words that don't contain them. We also know that 'C' is fixed in the first position.

Considering the constraints, I want to try to place 'A' and 'S' in positions where they can be tested effectively. Let's try a word that utilizes common vowels and consonants. 'CASES' is a possibility, but 'S' is yellow, so it can't be the second letter. 'CLASS' is another possibility, but 'S' is yellow.

Let's try a word that puts 'A' in the second position and 'S' in the fourth. This would give us 'C _ A _ S'.  The remaining letters to choose from are those not in the gray list.

I'll go with 'CAPES'. It uses 'A' and 'S' in the correct positions, and 'C' in the first. It avoids all the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `C _ _ _ S`. The yellow letter is 'A', meaning 'A' is in the word but not in the fourth position. The gray letters are D, E, H, I, L, N, P, R, U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' is in the word, and it's not in the fourth position, it must be in one of the first three spots. The word ends in 'S'. Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Let's try to build a word that incorporates 'A' and 'S' and avoids the gray letters. A good starting point would be to consider common consonant combinations around 'C'.

I'll prioritize a word that uses 'A' in one of the first three positions and includes 'S' at the end. I want to maximize information gain with my next guess.

I'm going to guess 'CRAFT'. It uses 'A' and 'S', avoids the gray letters, and places 'A' in a position where it could be green or yellow.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word is `C _ _ _ S`. The yellow letter is 'A', meaning 'A' is in the word but not in the fourth position. The gray letters are all the letters *not* in the word. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Given the 'C' is in the first position and 'S' is in the last, we need to find a word that fits those constraints and incorporates 'A' somewhere in the middle three positions.

Considering the excluded letters, and the need to place 'A', let's think about common vowel combinations and consonant pairings that could work. 'CARES' is a possibility, but 'S' is already in the last position. 'CRAFT' was already guessed, so we can't use that.

Let's try to build a word around 'A' in the second or third position. 'CHAPS' is a possibility, but 'P' is gray. 'CRAWL' is another possibility, but 'L' is gray. 'CAILS' is a possibility, but 'I' is gray.

I'll prioritize words with common letter combinations. 'CARTS' seems like a strong contender. It uses 'A' in the second position, and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Let's try a word that uses common consonants and avoids the excluded letters. 'BLAST' is a possibility. It contains 'A' and doesn't use C, D, E, I, N, R, or U. The 'A' is not in the last position.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ _ S _` and the yellow letters are 'A' and 'L'. The gray letters are all the others. This means the word must contain S, and cannot contain A, L, B, C, D, E, I, N, R, T, or U.

Given the 'S' in the last position, and the yellow letters 'A' and 'L' needing to be placed elsewhere, let's consider words that fit this pattern. Since 'A' and 'L' are unavailable, we need to build around those constraints.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in different positions to see where they fit best. Let's try a word that uses 'A' and 'L' in positions that aren't the last one.

Considering the constraints, a word like 'SALTS' seems promising. It uses 'S' in the correct position, and 'A' and 'L' are available to be placed.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ A _ S _`. The yellow letter is 'L', meaning 'L' is not in the word. The gray letters are B, C, D, E, I, N, R, T, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'A' is in the second position, and 'S' is in the fourth, we need to find a word that fits this structure and avoids the gray letters. The 'L' must be excluded.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize using common letters in the remaining slots to maximize information gain. Let's try a word with a frequent vowel in the fifth position. ‘WORDS’ is a good candidate, but it contains ‘D’ which is not in the gray list. Let’s try ‘FLASK’. It has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s consider words with ‘K’ or ‘M’ in the first position. ‘KALMS’ is a possibility, but ‘M’ is not in the gray list. ‘KALPS’ is also a possibility.

Let’s try ‘PLASH’. It has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘CLASH’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘FLASH’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘PLAZA’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘SALTS’. This word is already guessed.

Let’s try ‘ALMS’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘LAWS’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘PAILS’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

Let’s try ‘SALON’. This word has ‘L’ in the wrong position, so it’s not correct.

I’m struggling to find a word that fits all the constraints. I need to think about common letter combinations. The 'A' is fixed, and 'S' is fixed

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `S _ U _ _` as the starting pattern. The yellow letters are 'T', meaning 'T' is in the word but not in the current positions. The gray letters are A, D, E, H, I, L, N, Q, R, so we know the word doesn't contain any of those.

Given the 'S' and 'U' are fixed, and 'T' is present, we need to find letters to fill the blanks that aren't in the gray list. Let's consider common vowels and consonants. Since 'T' is yellow, it can't be in positions 2 or 4.

Let's try to build a word around the 'U' and incorporating the 'T'. Considering the constraints, a good approach is to try to place 'T' in a position where it's not yellow.

I'll start with a word that includes 'T' and avoids the gray letters, and tries to use common letters. ‘STUNT’ is a possibility, but the ‘T’ is yellow, so it’s not ideal. ‘SHUNT’ was already guessed.

Let’s try ‘STUDY’. This uses the ‘U’ and ‘T’ and avoids the gray letters. It also places ‘T’ in a position that could be yellow.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word starts with 'S', has 'U' in the third position, and the 'T' is in the wrong spot. The gray letters eliminate a significant number of possibilities. We need to find a word that incorporates 'T' but not in the position it was previously yellow.

Considering the constraints, the remaining letters we can use are likely to be common consonants and vowels. The 'T' must go in one of the last two positions. Let's try to build a word around the 'U' in the third position.

I'll prioritize using the yellow 'T' in the last position, as it's a relatively common letter. I want to test common vowel combinations. 'ROUTE' is a possibility, but it uses 'E' which is gray. 'SUITS' is another possibility, and it uses the 'T' in the correct position.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no yellow or gray letters. This means all letters in the word are currently unknown. The gray letters (A, D, E, I, U) are definitively *not* in the word. Since there are no yellow letters, we can proceed with a strategic guess to introduce new, potentially helpful letters.

I want to maximize information gain. A good starting point is to use a word with common vowels and consonants that haven't been tried yet. 'CRANE' seems like a reasonable choice – it uses several common letters and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'C'. The letters A, D, E, I, N, R, and U are not in the word. The yellow letters are 'C'. This means the word must contain 'C' but not any of the gray letters.

Since 'C' is in the last position, we know the word is in the form _ _ _ _ C. We need to find a word that uses 'C' in the last position and avoids the gray letters. Let's consider common letters that could fit in the first few positions.

Given the gray letters, some common vowels are eliminated. Let's try to build a word around 'C' that uses some of the remaining possibilities.

I'll start with a word that includes a common consonant and a vowel that isn't in the gray list. 'BLOC' is a possibility. It uses 'C' in the correct position and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Given the gray letters, and the 'E' in the last position, let's try to build a word that utilizes the 'U' effectively. I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow 'U' in a position where it can potentially be green if it's in the word.

Considering the letters available and the constraints, the word 'DEMISE' seems promising. It uses all the yellow letters and doesn't include any of the gray letters. Let's check if it fits the green letters.

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common, frequent letters. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels and avoids any letters that could be grayed out easily. It will quickly reveal whether vowels are present and in the correct positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in an unknown letter, and the 'A' is in the word but not in the fifth position. We also know the letters D, E, I, and U are not in the word.  Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  Given that ADIEU has been guessed, we can eliminate those letters.

My strategy here is to try and place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively, and introduce new, potentially useful letters. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses the yellow 'A' and avoids the gray letters. It also tests the common letters 'C', 'R', 'N', and 'E'.

Given the 'R' in the third position, and the yellow letters 'A' and 'O' needing to be placed, let's consider possible placements for A and O. Since 'A' is yellow, it can't be in the first or last position. Similarly, 'O' can't be in the first or last position.

Let's try to build a word around the 'R' in the third position. Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try to incorporate the yellow letters strategically.

This significantly reduces the possibilities. Let's consider common letters and positions. Since 'I', 'P', and 'U' are in the word but not in the last position, they must be in the first, second, or third positions.  The gray letters eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Given the constraints, I want to prioritize revealing letters in the first few positions. A good strategy is to use a word with common consonants and avoid letters already ruled out.

Let's try a word that uses the available letters and avoids the restricted ones. ‘SPITE’ seems like a reasonable option. It contains I, P, and U, and doesn’t include any of the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no green letters initially. The yellow letters ('I', 'P', 'S', 'U') must be present in the word, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow squares. The gray letters ('A', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'K', 'L', 'M', 'N', 'R', 'T') are definitively *not* in the word.

Given the constraints, I need to build a word that incorporates the yellow letters and avoids the gray letters. Since we have four yellow letters, I want to prioritize using them in a way that maximizes information gain. I'll start by considering common vowel and consonant combinations.

Let's consider words that contain 'I', 'P', 'S', and 'U'. A good starting point would be to try a word with 'U' as the second letter, as it's a relatively common vowel. Also, 'P' is a frequent consonant.

I'll start with the word 'SPURN'. It contains 'U' and 'P', and avoids the gray letters. It doesn't have 'I' or 'S' in the correct positions, so it's not a good choice.

Let's try 'PURIS'. This word contains 'U', 'P', 'I', and 'S'. It avoids the gray letters. It doesn't have 'I' in the correct position, so it's not ideal.

Let's try 'UPINS'. This word contains 'U', 'P', 'I', 'S', and 'N'. It avoids the gray letters. It doesn't have 'I' or 'S' in the correct positions.

Considering the constraints, I'll aim for a word that places the yellow letters in positions where they can be confirmed or eliminated in the next guess. I'll try 'SUPPIE'. This word contains 'U', 'P', 'I', 'S', and 'E'. It avoids the gray letters. It doesn't have 'I' or 'S' in the correct positions.

I'll try 'PIUS'. This word contains 'U', 'P', 'I', and 'S'. It avoids the gray letters. It doesn't have 'I' or 'S' in the correct positions.

Let's try 'PURSE

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `A _ _ _ _` as the starting pattern. The gray letters are D, E, I, and U, meaning those letters are not in the word at all. The yellow letters are none, so we haven't identified any letters that are in the word but not in the correct position.

Since we've already guessed ADIEU, and it was entirely gray, we know that A is in the word, but not in any of the positions we tried before. We need to find a word that starts with 'A' and doesn't contain D, E, I, or U.

Let's consider common vowels and consonants. 'O' and 'S' are not in the gray list, so they could be possibilities. A good strategy is to try to introduce new letters and confirm their positions. 'CRANE' fits the pattern and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It's a reasonable choice to test the 'N' position.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word starts with 'A', and the 'R' is in the word but not in the third position. The gray letters are C, D, E, I, N, and U. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'R' is yellow, it can be in positions 2, 3, or 4. We need to find a word that fits the 'A' in the first position and includes 'R' somewhere else. Let's consider common letters and patterns.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's try to build a word around the 'R' and see what works.

I'll start by trying a word that uses the 'R' in a position other than the third. 'ARBOR' is a possibility. It uses 'A' in the first position and 'R' in the second. The remaining letters would need to be filled with letters not in the gray list.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `A _ _ _ _` as the starting pattern. The yellow letters are 'O' and 'R'. The gray letters are 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'I', 'N', 'U'. This means the word cannot contain any of those letters.

We need to place 'O' and 'R' in the remaining four slots, avoiding the gray letters. Let's consider possible positions for 'R'. Since it's yellow, it must be in one of the last four positions.

If 'R' is in the second position, we have `A R _ _ _`.  We need to place 'O' in one of the remaining three spots.

Let's try a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern. 'ARSON' is a possibility. It uses 'R' in the second position, 'O' in the third, and satisfies all other constraints.

Let's check if 'ARSON' is a valid word and if it violates any existing clues. It is a valid word and doesn't contain any of the gray letters. It also doesn't match any of the previously guessed words.

Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize placing 'R' in a position where it's more likely to be correct. Since it's yellow, it *must* be in the word. Let's try to place it in the second or third position.

If I put 'R' in the second position, I have `A R _ _ _`. Now I need to fit 'O' somewhere, avoiding the gray letters. A good starting point would be to try a common vowel in the third or fourth position.

Let's consider the word 'ARSON'. It's already been guessed, so we can't use it. However, it gives us a good idea of a possible structure.

Let's try a word with 'O' in the third position: `A R O _ _`.  We need to fill the remaining spots with letters that aren't B, C, D, E, I, N, S, or U.  'T' and 'L' are good candidates.

Let's try to build a word that fits this pattern. Considering common letter combinations and avoiding the gray letters, a good starting point would be to use a vowel in the fourth position.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the yellow letters are 'A' and 'L'. The gray letters are 'D', 'I', 'N', 'P', and 'U'. We've already ruled out ADIEU and PLANE.

The 'E' is in the last position. This significantly narrows things down. Since 'A' and 'L' are yellow, they cannot be in the first, second, or third positions.  Let's consider possible letters for the first position.

If we place 'L' in the second position, we have `_ L _ E _`.  The yellow 'A' must go in the third or fourth position.

Let's try to build a word around this. Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

I'll start with a guess that incorporates the yellow letters and the known 'E' in the correct position. ‘FLARE’ is a possibility, but it uses ‘R’ which is not a yellow letter.

Let’s try ‘SCALE’. This uses ‘A’ and ‘L’ as yellow letters and has ‘E’ in the correct position. It also avoids the gray letters.

Given the 'E' in the fifth position, we need to find a word that fits this pattern and incorporates 'A' and 'L' in the first two positions. Since 'A' and 'L' are yellow, they can't be in the third, fourth, or sixth positions.

Let's consider common letter combinations. The 'E' in the fifth position suggests vowels are likely.  Also, since 'A' and 'L' are yellow, they must be in the first two positions.

A good starting point would be to try words with 'L' and 'A' at the beginning.  Let's consider words that frequently use 'L' and 'A' at the start.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the yellow letters are 'A' and 'L'. The gray letters are C, D, F, I, N, P, R, S, and U. This means the word cannot contain any of those letters.

Since 'E' is in the last position, we know the word ends in 'E'.  We need to place 'A' and 'L' somewhere in the first three positions.  Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Let's think about common letter combinations. 'AL' is a frequent pairing.  Since 'A' is yellow, it can't be the first letter.  Similarly, 'L' can't be the first letter.

Let's try to build a word around 'AL' in the first two positions.  Possible words ending in 'E' that include 'A' and 'L' are difficult to immediately conjure.

Given the constraints, a good strategy is to try to place the yellow letters in positions where they are more likely to be correct. Since 'A' is yellow, let's try placing it in the second position. Since 'L' is yellow, let's try placing it in the third position. This gives us `_ A L E _`.

Now we need to find a fifth letter that isn't in the gray list and fits the pattern.  Let's consider common consonants. 'B', 'G', 'H', 'J', 'K', 'M', 'Q', 'V', 'W', 'X', 'Y', 'Z' are all valid.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'I'. The yellow letters are 'I', and the gray letters are A, D, E, and U. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, U, or I.

Since 'I' is in the last position, we need to build a word around that. The yellow letters must be placed in the remaining four positions. We need to find a combination of those letters that forms a valid word.

Considering the constraints, let's think about common letter combinations. The 'I' is fixed at the end. Let's try to incorporate the yellow letters strategically.

A good starting point would be to consider common vowel and consonant pairings. 'ROBIN' is a possible word, but it contains a letter that is gray (U). 'TRAIN' is another possibility, but it contains a letter that is gray (A).

Let's try a word that uses the yellow letters in a different order. 'WORST' is a possibility, but it contains a letter that is gray (A).

Let's try 'PRIOR'. This word uses the yellow letters 'I', 'O', 'R' and it doesn't contain any of the gray letters. The 'P' is not in the word, so it's a valid guess.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with no green letters initially. The yellow letters are 'I', meaning they are present in the word but not in the correct positions. The gray letters are all the letters *not* in the word. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Given the yellow 'I', I need to place it somewhere in the word. Since 'I' is yellow, it cannot be in any of the positions marked green. I need to prioritize introducing new letters and testing common vowel placements.

Considering the gray letters, I can eliminate many common letters. Let's start by trying a word that uses the 'I' in a common position, like the second or third spot.

I'll go with a word that includes the 'I' and avoids the gray letters. ‘SHINE’ seems like a reasonable starting point. It uses the ‘I’ and avoids all the gray letters.

My strategy here is to try to place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively, and introduce new letters to narrow down the possibilities. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses the yellow 'A' and avoids the gray letters. It also tests a common vowel and a common consonant.

Let's consider words that start with 'A' and contain 'R' and 'K'.  'MARK' is a possibility, but it's already been guessed. 'DARK' is also a possibility, but it doesn't fit the pattern. 'WARK' is not a valid word.

Let's think about common letter combinations. 'ARK' is a frequent pattern.  If we can get 'ARK' in the word, we just need to find a suitable letter for the first and last positions.

Given the gray letters, the first position can't be B, C, D, E, I, N, O, P, or U. The last position can't be B, C, D, E, I, N, O, P, or U.

Let's try 'TRAK'. It fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters. It's a valid word.

*   It must end in a letter that isn't A, E, or I (due to the yellow letters).
*   It must not contain D or U.
*   It has already been guessed as ADIEU.

Given these constraints, I want to prioritize letters that haven't been ruled out. The remaining alphabet is: B, C, F, G, H, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Since we need to avoid A, E, I, D, and U, I'll focus on common consonants and vowels that haven't been eliminated. 'LOST' is a good candidate as it uses several of the remaining letters and avoids the restricted ones.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ _ E _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'D', meaning they are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are 'I' and 'U', so they are definitively not in the word.

We need to incorporate 'A' and 'D' somewhere in the remaining three slots, avoiding 'I' and 'U'.  Since 'E' is already in the last position, we need to consider how to place 'A' and 'D' strategically.

Let's think about common letter combinations. Given the constraints, a word like 'CRADE' or 'DRAZE' might be possibilities, but we need to avoid using letters already guessed.

Considering the existing clues, a good approach is to try to place 'D' in a position where it can be confirmed or eliminated quickly. Let's try a word that uses 'D' early on.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of the letters M, R, or U (from the yellow letters).
*   It cannot contain A, C, D, E, I, P (from the gray letters).
*   It must match the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`.
*   We've already guessed ADIEU and CRUMP.

Given the yellow letters, I need to consider words that end in M, R, or U and avoid the gray letters. Let's start by thinking about common vowels and consonants that haven't been ruled out. Since we have 'M', 'R', and 'U' as possibilities for the last letter, I want to try to introduce some of those letters into positions where they can be confirmed or eliminated.

I'll start with a word that includes 'U' in the last position, as it's one of the yellow letters. Also, I want to test some common consonants. 'FLOUR' fits the criteria and includes 'U' at the end. It avoids the gray letters and uses the yellow letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the last letter is 'R'. The yellow letters are M, O, and U, meaning they are present in the word but not in the last position. The gray letters are A, C, D, E, F, I, L, P. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'R' is fixed, and we need to incorporate M, O, and U, let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The existing guesses eliminate several possibilities.

I want to prioritize revealing more letters. A good strategy is to use the yellow letters in different positions to see where they fit. Let's try a word that uses 'O' and 'U' in the middle, and 'M' in a position that isn't the last.

Considering the constraints, 'MOURN' seems like a strong candidate. It uses the yellow letters, has 'R' in the correct position, and doesn't use any of the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the last letter is 'R'. The yellow letters are 'M', 'O', and 'U', meaning they are present in the word but not in the last position. The gray letters are all the letters *not* in the word.

Given the constraints, we need to build a word around 'R' that incorporates 'M', 'O', and 'U' in the first four positions, avoiding the gray letters. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.

Since 'M', 'O', and 'U' are present, and 'R' is fixed at the end, we need to find a combination that works. The word cannot contain A, C, D, E, F, I, L, N, P.

Let's try to build a word that uses the yellow letters strategically. Considering the constraints, a word like "MOURS" is impossible because 'M' is yellow and 'S' is gray.

Let's try to create a word with 'O' as the second letter.  If we put 'O' in the second position, we have _ O _ _ R. We need to fit 'M' and 'U' into the remaining slots.

I'll start with a word that uses 'O' in the second position and tries to incorporate 'M' and 'U' in the first and third positions. 'UMOUR' is a possibility, but 'U' is yellow, so it's not ideal.

Let's consider a word with 'U' in the third position. _ _ U _ R. We need to fit 'M' and 'O'. 'MOURS' is not possible because 'S' is gray.

Let's try 'ROMUS'. 'R' is in the correct position, 'M' and 'O' are yellow, 'U' is yellow, and 'S' is gray. This doesn't work because 'S' is gray.

Let's try 'WOMUR'. 'W' is not in the gray list. 'O' is yellow, 'M' is yellow, 'U' is yellow, and 'R' is in the correct position. This is a good candidate.

Since we've already guessed ADIEU, SLICE, and FIBER, we can avoid those. Let's think about common vowel and consonant combinations that fit the structure. Considering the constraints, a word like "PIVIE" is not possible because of the gray letters.

Let's try to build a word around the 'I' and 'E' positions. The remaining letters can be any combination of consonants that aren't in the gray list.

I'll start with a word that uses common consonants and avoids any of the excluded letters. 'JOICE' is a possibility, but it uses 'J' which isn't allowed. 'QUIET' seems promising, but it has a 'Q' which is not allowed.

Let's try 'CIVIL'. It fits the pattern and doesn't use any of the gray letters. This is a good, solid guess to confirm the presence of 'C', 'I', 'V', and 'L'.

Since we know 'I' is in the third position, and we need to avoid the gray letters, we can start by considering common vowels and consonants that haven't been ruled out.

The remaining letters to consider are: G, H, J, K, M, N, O, P, Q, T, W, X, Y, Z.

Given the constraints, a good strategy is to try to place some of the remaining letters in positions where they could potentially be green. Let's try to incorporate some of the more common consonants.

I'll start with a word that includes 'T' and 'N', as these are relatively frequent letters. 'TINIE' is a possibility, but it uses 'N' which is not in the gray list. Let's try 'POINT'.</think>

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ I N E`. The yellow letter is 'T', meaning 'T' is in the word but not in the third position. The gray letters eliminate a huge number of possibilities. We need to build a word around this structure, keeping in mind the constraints.

Since 'T' is in the word, and 'I' and 'E' are fixed, let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. The gray letters rule out many common letters.

Let's try to incorporate 'T' into a plausible position. Given the existing letters, a good starting point would be to try a word with 'T' in the second or fourth position.

Considering the constraints, a word like "TINIE" is not possible because 'I' is already in the third position. Let's try to build around the 'T' in the second position.

I'll prioritize words that use common letters and avoid the eliminated ones. ‘STINE’ is a possibility, but it’s a less common word. Let’s try to find something more frequent.

Let's consider common letters and positions. The 'D' can't be in the third position, so it must be in the first or second. I want to try to confirm the presence of a common vowel in the first position.

My initial thought is to try a word with 'D' in the first position and a common vowel in the second. ‘CRUDE’ is a possibility, but it uses ‘U’ which is gray. ‘DREAD’ is another possibility, but it uses ‘A’ which is gray. ‘DEALT’ is a good option as it uses a common consonant and doesn’t use any of the gray letters.

Let's consider words that start with 'D' and contain E.  A good starting point would be to try a word that uses the yellow letters in a way that doesn't immediately eliminate too many possibilities.

'DOVER' is a potential word, but it contains 'V' which is a yellow letter. 'DOPER' is also a possibility, but it contains 'P' which is not in the gray list.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and the gray letters are A, D, I, and U. This means the word cannot contain any of those letters. Since there are no yellow letters, we need to strategically place the known 'E' in the correct position.  Given the constraints, I want to maximize the chance of revealing new letters. A good starting point would be a word with common vowels and consonants. 'CRANE' seems like a reasonable choice, as it uses several common letters and places the 'E' in the correct spot.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ _ _ E _` and 'R' is a yellow letter, meaning it's in the word but not in the third position. Also, 'A', 'C', 'D', 'I', 'N', and 'U' are not in the word.

Given the 'E' in the fifth position, and 'R' somewhere else, I need to find a placement for 'R' that doesn't conflict with the existing 'E'.  I want to prioritize using the yellow 'R' in a position where it's more likely to reveal other letters.

Let's consider words with 'R' in the second or fourth position.  Since 'A', 'C', 'D', 'I', 'N', and 'U' are out, and 'E' is fixed, I'll focus on building around those constraints.

I'll start with a word that includes 'R' in the second position, as this is a common position for 'R' in English words. 'BRIDE' is a possibility, but it contains 'D' which is gray. 'PRIME' is another option, but it contains 'I' which is gray. 'VERGE' seems promising.

I'll start with a word that includes 'R' in a position other than the third, and uses common letters. ‘BRIDE’ is a possibility, but ‘BRIDE’ has a ‘D’ which is not in the gray list.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `S H E E _` as the confirmed pattern. The yellow letter is 'L', meaning 'L' is in the word but not in the fifth position. The gray letters eliminate a significant number of possibilities. We need to find a word that includes 'L' and doesn't contain A, C, D, F, I, K, N, O, R, U.

Considering the existing letters and the constraints, let's think about common five-letter words that fit the pattern. The 'E's in the second and third positions suggest a vowel-heavy word. 'L' must go in the fifth position.

Your task is to find a valid 5-letter English word that fits all the clues above.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ _ A _ E`. The yellow letters are 'N', so 'N' is not in the word. The gray letters are 'D', 'I', 'L', 'P', and 'U', meaning those letters are also not in the word.

We need to place 'N' somewhere else, and we have a 'A' in the third position. This significantly limits our options. Considering the remaining slots, and the fact that we've already guessed 'ADIEU' and 'PLANE', let's focus on common vowel and consonant combinations.

The structure is now `_ _ A _ E`. Let's try to incorporate the 'N' into a word that fits this pattern. Since 'N' is yellow, it can't be in the first or last position.

Let's consider words with 'A' in the third position and 'E' at the end. A good strategy is to try to use the yellow 'N' in a different position to see if it helps narrow things down.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and fits the pattern. ‘MANTE’ is a possibility. It uses the ‘A’ and ‘E’ in the correct positions, and the ‘N’ is not present.

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters and a good distribution of vowels and consonants. 'ADIEU' is a strong choice because it uses four common vowels. It will quickly reveal whether any of those vowels are present in the word and their positions.

*   It cannot contain A, C, D, E, F, H, I, L, O, R.
*   It must include the letters K, N, or U in positions that aren't the fifth.

Given the gray letters, we've eliminated a significant portion of the English vocabulary. The yellow letters (K, N, U) are somewhat restrictive. Since we need to use these letters, and they aren't in the last position, we need to consider how they might fit into the first four positions.

Let's try to build a word around the yellow letters. Considering the constraints, a word like "JUNKS" or "KNUTZ" are possibilities, but let's prioritize words that might reveal more information about the remaining letters.

I'll start with a word that includes 'N' and 'U' in the first two positions, and 'K' in the third. This will help me determine if 'N' and 'U' are adjacent, and if 'K' is near the beginning.

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain. I'll select a word with common vowels and consonants to cover as much of the alphabet as possible. 'ADIEU' is a good choice – it uses four common vowels and avoids any letters that could be grayed out later.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'U', meaning those letters must be in the word, but not in the positions we've already tried. The gray letters are 'D', 'E', and 'I', so those letters cannot be in the word at all. We've already guessed 'ADIEU', so that word is out.

Now we need to build a word that includes 'A' and 'U' and excludes 'D', 'E', and 'I'.  Since 'A' and 'U' are present, let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations.  The remaining slots need to be filled with letters that aren't D, E, I.

Let's try to incorporate the yellow letters strategically. Since 'A' and 'U' are yellow, let's try placing them in positions where they are more likely to be correct.

I'll start with a word that uses common letters and tests the yellow letters in different positions. 'FLAUN' seems like a good candidate. It uses 'A' and 'U', and avoids the gray letters.

I'll start with a guess that incorporates 'A' and 'I' in positions that aren't green, and avoids the excluded letters. ‘CLAIM’ fits the criteria. It uses ‘A’ and ‘I’ and doesn’t contain ‘D’, ‘E’, or ‘U’.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in one of A, C, I, or M.
*   It must contain A, C, I, and M in positions that are *not* the last position.
*   It must *not* contain D, E, L, or U.

Given these constraints, we need to build a word that incorporates these letters and avoids the excluded letters. The available letters are B, F, G, H, J, K, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, V, W, X, Y, Z.

Considering the yellow letters, let's try to build around them. Since 'A', 'C', 'I', and 'M' are yellow, we know they are present but not in the last position. Let's consider words that could potentially fit the pattern.

A good starting point is to try a word that uses the yellow letters in a way that doesn't immediately conflict with the green letters. 'MAGIC' is a possibility, but it uses 'G' which is not yellow. 'CAMIS' is also a possibility, but it uses 'S' which is gray.

Let's try a word that uses 'M' as the last letter, as it's a yellow letter.  'TIMAC' doesn't work because 'T' is gray. 'MACID' doesn't work because 'D' is gray.

Let's try to build a word that incorporates 'A', 'C', 'I', and 'M' in the first, second, third, and fourth positions, respectively. This leaves the last position open.

I'll go with a word that uses the yellow letters in a way that maximizes information. 'CAMIC' is a possibility, but it uses 'C' which is yellow.

Let's try 'IMPACT'. It uses 'I' and 'M' in the correct positions, and 'A' and 'C' are yellow. It avoids the gray letters. This is a strong candidate.

Since 'A' and 'U' are yellow, they can't be in the positions we already tried. Let's try to build a word around the known letters. Considering the constraints, a good strategy is to try to place 'A' and 'U' in positions where they aren't already present.

Let's consider words that contain 'A' and 'U'. A common vowel combination is 'AU'. I'll try to build a word around that.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the following constraints:

*   It must end in a letter that isn't D, E, or I.
*   It must contain D, E, and I, but not in the positions indicated by the yellow letters.
*   It cannot contain A or U.
*   We've already guessed ADIEU.

Given these constraints, we need to find a word that incorporates D, E, and I, and avoids A, U, D, E, and I. This significantly limits our options. Let's consider common letter combinations and potential word structures. Since we know the word *must* contain D, E, and I, and we've eliminated A and U, let's focus on consonants that could fit in the remaining slots.

Considering the yellow letters, we need to place D, E, and I in positions where they aren't in the yellow positions. A good strategy is to try to use the yellow letters in different positions to see if we can narrow it down.

Let's try a word that uses common vowels and consonants. 'CHIDE' seems like a reasonable option. It contains D, E, and I, and doesn't use A or U. It also avoids the yellow letters.

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common letters and frequent vowel/consonant combinations. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels. It will quickly reveal whether any of those vowels are present in the word and in the correct positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'E'. The yellow clue tells us 'E' is in the word, but not in the last position. We know the letters A, D, I, and U are not in the word. This significantly narrows down the possibilities.

Since 'E' is in the word, and we've already guessed 'ADIEU', we need to find a word that doesn't contain those letters. The goal is to maximize information gain with the next guess. Let's consider common vowels and consonants that haven't been ruled out.

Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try a word with a common vowel other than 'A' or 'E', and a frequent consonant. 'CRANE' seems promising. It uses the yellow letter 'E' and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'E', and the yellow letters are 'R'. We also know the word doesn't contain A, C, D, I, N, or U.  And we've already tried ADIEU and CRANE.

The 'R' must be in one of the first four positions. Since 'R' is yellow, it's not in the fourth or fifth position (as the fifth is 'E'). This means 'R' can be in positions 1, 2, or 3.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's try to build a word around the 'R' and the 'E' at the end.  A good strategy is to use the yellow 'R' in a position where it's more likely to be correct.

Let's consider words with 'R' in the first position.  A common vowel to try after 'R' is 'O'.  If we try 'ROOTE', it doesn't fit the gray letters. Let's try 'PROXY'. This uses the 'R' and 'E' and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word ends in 'E'. We have 'R' in the word but not in the fifth position. The gray letters are A, C, D, I, N, O, P, U, X, and Y. This significantly reduces the possibilities.

Since 'R' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  We need to find a word that incorporates 'R' and ends in 'E'. Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants.

Let's consider words with 'R' in the first, second, or third position.  A good strategy is to try to place 'R' in a position where it's more likely to be correct based on the other yellow letters.

I'll start with a word that includes 'R' in the second position and a common vowel. 'BRIDE' is a possibility, but 'D' is gray, so it's not viable. 'CRANE' was already guessed, so we can't use it.

Let's try 'VERGE'. It has 'R' in the second position, 'E' at the end, and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also doesn't conflict with any previously guessed words.

Since we have 'E' twice in the correct positions, we know the word must contain two 'E's. The remaining letters must be from the allowed set.

Given the existing guesses (ADIEU, CRANE, PROXY, VERGE), we can eliminate many common letters. The 'R' and 'G' are fixed in place.  We need to find a word that fits the pattern and uses only allowed letters.

Let's consider common five-letter words with 'E' twice.  A good starting point would be to try to incorporate the 'R' and 'G' strategically.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`. The yellow letters are 'E' and 'U', meaning these letters must be in the word, but not in the positions we've already tried. The gray letters are 'A', 'D', and 'I', so these letters cannot be in the word at all. We've already guessed ADIEU, so we know those letters are out.

Now we need to construct a word using 'E' and 'U' and avoiding 'A', 'D', and 'I'. Let's consider common vowel and consonant combinations. Since 'E' and 'U' are present, and we need to avoid A, D, and I, let's try to build a word that utilizes common consonants.

Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try a word with 'R' or 'S' as it's a common letter and hasn't been ruled out. Let's try 'CREEK'. It uses 'E' and 'U' and avoids 'A', 'D', and 'I'.</think>

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in an unknown letter, and the 'A' is in the word but not in the fifth position. We also know the letters D, E, I, and U are not in the word.  Since 'A' is yellow, it must be in one of the first four positions.  Given that ADIEU has been guessed, we can eliminate those letters.

My strategy here is to try to place the 'A' in a different position and introduce new, potentially helpful letters. I want to avoid repeating letters that have already been ruled out. 'CRANE' seems like a good option – it uses the 'A' in a different position, and introduces the letter 'N' which hasn't been used yet.

Since we have 'A' in the third position, we need to focus on finding a word that fits this pattern and avoids the excluded letters. Considering common vowels and consonants, and the fact that we haven't guessed anything yet, I'll aim for a word with frequent letters.

Let's try to build a word around 'A'. Words like 'BLAST' or 'FLASK' are possibilities, but we need to consider the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the pattern `_ _ _ _ _`.

Provide your reasoning within <think> tags, and then your final guess within <guess> tags.

FULL RAW OUTPUT:
<think>
Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a 5-letter word with the last letter being 'U'. The yellow letters are 'U', and the gray letters are 'A', 'D', 'E', and 'I'. This means the word cannot contain A, D, E, I, and must contain U.

Since 'U' is in the last position, we need to find a combination of letters that fit the remaining four slots, avoiding the gray letters. Considering the constraints, I want to prioritize common letters and try to place the 'U' in a position where it can potentially be green.

Let's consider words that end in 'U'. A good starting point would be to use common consonants. 'CRUMP' is a possibility, but it contains 'D' which is gray. 'PLUMP' is another possibility, but it contains 'P' which is gray. 'BLUNT' is also a possibility, but it contains 'B' which is gray.

Let's try a word with a common vowel in the second position. 'FLUNK' is a possibility, but it contains 'K' which is gray. 'CHUNK' is another possibility, but it contains 'C' which is gray.

Given the constraints, I'll go with a word that uses common letters and maximizes the chance of revealing more information. 'BRUSH' is a good option. It uses common letters and avoids the gray letters.

Considering the gray letters, we can eliminate many vowels and consonants. The word cannot contain A, C, D, I, N, or U.

Let's try to build a word around the 'R' and 'E'. A good strategy is to try to place the 'R' in a position where it can be confirmed or eliminated.

I'll start with a word that includes 'R' and ends in 'E', and avoids the gray letters. 'PROXY' is a possibility, but it doesn't fit the green 'E' in the fifth position.

My strategy here is to try to place the 'A' in a position where it can be tested effectively and potentially reveal other letters. I want to avoid repeating letters that are already known to be absent.

Let's try a word that uses common consonants and tests the 'A' in the second position. 'CRANE' seems like a good candidate. It uses the yellow 'A' and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have a word that ends in either the letter ‘_’ or ‘_’ because the first guess was a blank slate. The yellow letters are 'A' and 'N'. This means the word must contain both 'A' and 'N', but not in the positions indicated by the yellow squares. The gray letters are C, D, E, I, R, and U, so we know the word cannot contain any of those letters.

Given these constraints, I need to find a 5-letter word that includes 'A' and 'N' and excludes C, D, E, I, R, and U. Let's consider common letter combinations and potential word structures. Since we have no other clues, I'll aim for a word that uses common vowels and consonants.

I'll start by trying a word that places 'A' in a likely position, given the yellow clue. ‘MANGO’ is a possibility, but it contains ‘G’ which is not in the gray list. ‘PANIC’ is another possibility, but it contains ‘I’ which is in the gray list. ‘SNACK’ is a good option as it contains ‘A’ and ‘N’ and avoids the gray letters.

Okay, let's break this down. We know the word is `_ A _ _ S`. The yellow letters are K and N, meaning they are in the word but not in those positions. The gray letters are C, D, E, I, P, R, U. This significantly reduces our possibilities.

Since 'A' is fixed in the second position, and we need to place K and N, let's consider common letter combinations. The remaining slots are _ _ _ _ and we need to fit K and N in there.

Given the gray letters, we can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's try to build a word that utilizes the yellow letters strategically.

I'll start by trying a word that incorporates 'N' and 'K' in positions that aren't the last two.  'THANK' is a possibility, but 'K' is yellow, so it can't be in the third position. 'KNAPS' is another possibility, but 'P' is gray.

Considering the existing letters, we know 'A', 'I', and 'T' are in the correct positions. The remaining slots need to be filled with letters that aren't D, E, S, U, Y, or L. Let's think about common letter combinations. Since 'L' is out, we can explore possibilities for the last spot.

A good strategy here is to try to introduce new vowels and consonants to narrow down the possibilities. 'O', 'N', 'C', 'R', 'P', 'M', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'B', 'V', 'W' are all potential candidates.

Let's try a word that uses a common consonant and a vowel that hasn't been heavily tested. 'FLINT' seems promising. It uses 'L' which is yellow, but we need to avoid it. Let's reconsider.

Let's try to build a word around the 'AIT' core. 'PAINT' is a possibility, but 'L' is yellow. 'TRAIT' is another possibility, but 'L' is yellow.

I'll go with a word that uses a common vowel and a less common consonant. 'BLAST' is a possibility, but 'L' is yellow.

Let's try 'CLAIM'. It fits the pattern and doesn't use any of the gray letters. It also doesn't use 'L'.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We have `_ A I T _`. The yellow letter is 'L', meaning 'L' is not in the word. The gray letters are D, E, S, U, and Y, so those are also not in the word. We need to find a word that fits this pattern and includes 'L' nowhere.

Considering the existing letters, we know 'A', 'I', and 'T' are in the correct positions. The remaining slots need to be filled with letters that aren't D, E, S, U, Y, or L. Let's think about common letter combinations. Since 'L' is out, we can explore possibilities for the last spot.

A good strategy here is to try to introduce new vowels and consonants to narrow down the possibilities. 'O', 'N', 'C', 'R', 'P', 'M', 'F', 'G', 'H', 'B', 'V', 'W' are all potential candidates.

Let's try a word that uses a common consonant and a vowel that hasn't been heavily tested. 'FLINT' seems promising. It uses 'L' which is yellow, but we need to avoid it. Let's reconsider.

Okay, let's break this down. We have `_ A I T _`. The yellow letter is 'L', so 'L' cannot be in the word. The gray letters are C, D, E, M, S, U, and Y, meaning those letters are definitely not in the word. We need to place the 'L' somewhere else.

Given the existing letters, and the constraints, let's consider words that fit the pattern and use the available letters. The 'A' is fixed, the 'I' and 'T' are fixed. We need to place the 'L' and fill in the last spot.

Let's think about common vowel combinations. Since 'A' is already present, and 'I' is fixed, let's try to build around those. The word needs to include 'L'.

Considering the constraints, a good starting point would be to try words with 'L' in the last position.

Considering the constraints, let's think about common letters that could fit. The remaining letters that could potentially be in the fourth position are those not in the gray list.

Let's try to build a word around the known letters. The word must end in a letter that isn't L.

I'll start by considering common vowels and consonants. 'O', 'P', 'R', 'G', 'H', 'B', 'V', 'W' are possibilities.

Given the constraints, a good starting point would be to try a common consonant. Let's try 'R'. This would give us _ A I T R.

This is the very first guess. I need to maximize information gain by using a word with common, frequent letters. 'ADIEU' is a good choice because it uses four common vowels and avoids any letters that could be grayed out easily. It will quickly reveal whether vowels are present and in the correct positions.

Okay, let's analyze the clues. We know the word ends in 'E', and the second letter is not 'I'. We also know the word doesn't contain A, D, or U. The yellow letters are 'I', meaning they are present in the word but not in the second position.

Considering the gray letters, I can eliminate many common vowels and consonants. Let's try to build a word around the 'I' and the 'E'.

A good starting point would be to consider words with common consonants and try to place the 'I' in a position where it can be useful for future guesses.
